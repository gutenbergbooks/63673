    <h2>INTRODUCTORY.</h2>
  </div>
  <hr class="short" />

  <p><span class="smcap">The</span> summer of 1864 marked a period of unusual peril to the daring
    pioneers seeking homes in the far West. Following upon the horrible
    massacres in Minnesota in 1862, and the subsequent chastisements
    inflicted by the expeditions under Generals Sully and Sibley in
    1863, whereby the Indians were driven from the then western borders
    of civilization, in Iowa, Minnesota, and the white settlements of
    Dakota, in the Missouri Valley, the great emigrant trails to Idaho
    and Montana became the scene of fresh outrages; and, from the wild,
    almost inaccessible nature of the country, pursuit and punishment were
    impossible.</p>

  <p>I was a member of a small company of emigrants, who were attacked by
    an overwhelming force of hostile Sioux, which resulted in the death of
    a large proportion <span class="pagenum">vi</span>of the party, in my own capture, and a horrible
    captivity of five months’ duration.</p>

  <p>Of my thrilling adventures and experience during this season of terror
    and privation, I propose to give a plain, unvarnished narrative, hoping
    the reader will be more interested in facts concerning the habits,
    manners, and customs of the Indians, and their treatment of prisoners,
    than in theoretical speculations and fine-wrought sentences.</p>

  <p>Some explanation is due the public for the delay in publishing this
    my narrative. From memoranda, kept during the period of my captivity,
    I had completed the work for publication, when the manuscript was
    purloined and published; but the work was suppressed before it could be
    placed before the public. After surmounting many obstacles, I have at
    last succeeded in gathering the scattered fragments; and, by the aid of
    memory, impressed as I pray no mortal’s may ever be again, am enabled
    to place the results before, I trust, a kind-judging, appreciative
    public.</p>

      MARRIAGE&mdash;“HO! FOR IDAHO!”&mdash;CROSSING THE PLATTE RIVER&mdash;A STORM.</div>
  </div>

  <p><span class="smcap">I was</span> born in Orillia, Canada, in 1845. Our home was on the lake shore,
    and there amid pleasant surroundings I passed the happy days of early
    childhood.</p>

  <p>The years 1852 to 1856 witnessed, probably, the heaviest immigration
    the West has ever known in a corresponding length of time. Those who
    had gone before sent back to their friends such marvelous accounts of
    the fertility of the soil, the rapid development of the country, and
    the ease with which fortunes were made, the “Western fever” became
    almost epidemic. Whole towns in the old, Eastern States were almost
    depopulated. Old substantial farmers, surrounded apparently by all the
    comforts that heart could wish, sacrificed the homes wherein their
    families had been reared for generations, and, with all their worldly
    possessions, turned their faces toward the setting <span class="pagenum">12</span>sun. And with what
    high hopes! Alas! how few, comparatively, met their realization.</p>

  <p>In 1856, my father, James Wiggins, joined a New York colony bound for
    Kansas. Being favorably impressed with the country and its people, they
    located the town of Geneva, and my father returned for his family.</p>

  <p>Reaching the Missouri River on our way to our new home, my father was
    attacked with cholera, and died.</p>

  <p>In obedience to his dying instructions, my widowed mother, with her
    little family, continued on the way to our new home. But, oh! with what
    saddened hearts we entered into its possession. It seemed as if the
    light of our life had gone out. He who had been before to prepare that
    home for us, was not there to share it with us, and, far away from all
    early associations, almost alone in a new and sparsely settled country,
    it seemed as though hope had died.</p>

  <p>But God is merciful. He prepares the soul for its burdens. Of a truth,
    “He tempers the wind to the shorn lamb.”</p>

  <p>Our family remained in this pleasant prairie home, where I was married
    to Josiah S. Kelly.</p>

  <p>My husband’s health failing, he resolved upon a change of climate.
    Accordingly, on the 17th of May, 1864, a party of six persons,
    consisting of Mr. Gardner Wakefield, my husband, myself, our adopted
    daughter (my sister’s child), and two colored servants, started from
    Geneva, with high-wrought hopes and pleasant<span class="pagenum">13</span> anticipations of a
    romantic and delightful journey across the plains, and a confident
    expectation of future prosperity among the golden hills of Idaho.</p>

  <p>A few days after commencing our journey, we were joined by Mr. Sharp,
    a Methodist clergyman, from Verdigris River, about thirty miles south
    of Geneva; and, a few weeks later, we overtook a large train of
    emigrants, among whom were a family from Allen County with whom we
    were acquainted&mdash;Mr. Larimer, wife, and child, a boy eight years old.
    Preferring to travel with our small train, they left the larger one and
    became members of our party. The addition of one of my own sex to our
    little company was cause of much rejoicing to me, and helped relieve
    the dullness of our tiresome march.</p>

  <p>The hours of noon and evening rest were spent in preparing our frugal
    meals, gathering flowers with our children, picking berries, hunting
    curiosities, or gazing in wrapt wonder and admiration at the beauties
    of this strange, bewildering country.</p>

  <p>Our amusements were varied. Singing, reading, writing to friends at
    home, or pleasant conversation, occupied our leisure hours.</p>

  <p>So passed the first few happy days of our emigration to the land of
    sunshine and flowers.</p>

  <p>When the sun had set, when his last rays were flecking the towering
    peaks of the Rocky Mountains, gathering around the camp-fires, in our
    home-like tent,<span class="pagenum">14</span> we ate with a relish known only to those who, like us,
    scented the pure air, and lived as nature demanded.</p>

  <p>At night, when our camp had been arranged by Andy and Franklin, our
    colored men, it was always in the same relative position, Mr. Kelly
    riding a few miles ahead as evening drew near to select the camping
    ground.</p>

  <p>The atmosphere, which during the day was hot and stifling, became cool,
    and was laden with the odor of prairie flowers, the night dews filling
    their beautiful cups with the waters of heaven.</p>

  <p>The solemnity of night pervaded every thing. The warblings of the
    feathered tribe had ceased. The antelope and deer rested on the hills;
    no sound of laughing, noisy children, as in a settled country; no
    tramping of busy feet, or hurrying to and fro. All is silent. Nature,
    like man, has put aside the labors of the day, and is enjoying rest and
    peace.</p>

  <p>Yonder, as a tiny spark, as a distant star, might be seen from the road
    a little camp-fire in the darkness spread over the earth.</p>

  <p>Every eye in our little company is closed, every hand still, as we lay
    in our snugly-covered wagons, awaiting the dawn of another day.</p>

  <p>And the Eye that never sleeps watched over us in our lonely camp, and
    cared for the slumbering travelers.</p>

  <p>Mr. Wakefield, with whom we became acquainted after he came to settle
    at Geneva, proved a most agreeable <span class="pagenum">15</span>companion. Affable and courteous,
    unselfish, and a gentleman, we remember him with profound respect.</p>

  <p>A fine bridge crosses the Kansas River. A half-hour’s ride through the
    dense heavy timber, over a jet-black soil of incalculable richness,
    brought us to this bridge, which we crossed.</p>

  <p>We then beheld the lovely valley of the prairies, intersecting the deep
    green of graceful slopes, where waves tall prairie grass, among which
    the wild flowers grow.</p>

  <p>Over hundreds of acres these blossoms are scattered, yellow, purple,
    white, and blue, making the earth look like a rich carpet of variegated
    colors; those blooming in spring are of tender, modest hue, in later
    summer and early autumn clothed in gorgeous splendor. Solomon’s gold
    and purple could not outrival them.</p>

  <p>Nature seemingly reveled in beauty, for beauty’s sake alone, for none
    but the simple children of the forest to view her in state.</p>

  <p>Slowly the myriad years come and go upon her solitary places. Tender
    spring-time and glorious summer drop down their gifts from overflowing
    coffers, while the steps of bounding deer or the notes of singing birds
    break upon the lonely air.</p>

  <p>The sky is of wonderful clearness and transparency. Narrow belts and
    fringes of forest mark the way of winding streams.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">16</span></p>

  <p>In the distance rise conical mounds, wrapped in the soft veil of dim
    and dreamy haze.</p>

  <p>Upon the beaten road are emigrants wending their way, their household
    goods packed in long covered wagons, drawn by oxen, mules, or horses;
    speculators working their way to some new town with women and children;
    and we meet with half-breed girls, with heavy eye-lashes and sun-burnt
    cheeks, jogging along on horseback.</p>

  <p>I was surprised to see so many women among the emigrants, and to see
    how easily they adapted themselves to the hardships experienced in a
    journey across the plains.</p>

  <p>As a rule, the emigrants travel without tents, sleeping in and under
    wagons, without removing their clothing.</p>

  <p>Cooking among emigrants to the far West is a very primitive operation,
    a frying-pan and perhaps a Dutch oven comprising the major part of the
    kitchen furniture.</p>

  <p>The scarcity of timber is a source of great inconvenience and
    discomfort, “buffalo chips” being the substitute. At some of the
    stations, where opportunity offered, Mr. Kelly bought wood by the
    pound, as I had not yet been long enough inured to plains privations to
    relish food cooked over a fire made with “chips” of that kind.</p>

  <p>We crossed the Platte River by binding four wagon<span class="pagenum">17</span> boxes together, then
    loaded the boat with goods, and were rowed across by about twenty men.</p>

  <p>We were several days in crossing. Our cattle and horses swam across.
    The air had been heavy and oppressively hot; now the sky began to
    darken suddenly, and just as we reached the opposite shore, a gleam of
    lightning, like a forked tongue of flame, shot out of the black clouds,
    blinding us by its flash, and followed by a frightful crash of thunder.</p>

  <p>Another gleam and another crash followed, and the dense blackness
    lowered threateningly over us, almost shutting out the heights beyond,
    and seeming to encircle us like prisoners in the valley that lay at our
    feet.</p>

  <p>The vivid flashes lighting the darkness for an instant only made its
    gloom more fearful, and the heavy rolling of the thunder seemed almost
    to rend the heavens above it.</p>

  <p>All at once it burst upon our unprotected heads in rain. But such rain!
    Not the gentle droppings of an afternoon shower, nor a commonplace
    storm, but a sweeping avalanche of water, drenching us completely at
    the first dash, and continuing to pour, seeming to threaten the earth
    on which we stood, and tempt the old Platte to rise and claim it as its
    own.</p>

  <p>Our wagon covers had been removed in the fording, and we had no time to
    put up tents for our protection until its fury was exhausted. And so
    we were forced<span class="pagenum">18</span> to brave the elements, with part of our company on the
    other side of the swollen river, and a wild scene, we could scarcely
    discern through the pelting rain, surrounding us.</p>

  <p>One soon becomes heroic in an open-air life, and so we put up what
    shelter we could when the abating storm gave us opportunity; and,
    wringing the water out of clothes, hair, and eye-brows, we camped in
    cheerful hope of a bright to-morrow, which did not disappoint us, and
    our hundreds of emigrant companions scattered on the way.</p>

  <p>Each recurring Sabbath was gratefully hailed as a season of thought and
    repose; as a matter of conscience and duty we observed the day, and
    took pleasure in doing so.</p>

  <p>We had divine service performed, observing the ceremonies of prayer,
    preaching, and singing, which was fully appreciated in our absence from
    home and its religious privileges.</p>

  <p>Twenty-five miles from California Crossing is a place called Ash
    Hollow, where the eye is lost in space as it endeavors to penetrate its
    depths. Here some years before, General Harney made his name famous by
    an indiscriminate massacre of a band of hostile Indians, with their
    women and children.</p>

  </div>

  <p><span class="smcap">A train</span> of wagons were coursing their westward way, with visions of
    the future bright as our own. Sometimes a single team might be seen
    traveling alone.</p>

  <p>Our party were among the many small squads emigrating to the land of
    promise.</p>

  <p>The day on which our doomed family were scattered and killed was the
    12th of July, a warm and oppressive day. The burning sun poured forth
    its hottest rays upon the great Black Hills and the vast plains of
    Montana, and the great emigrant road was strewed with men, women, and
    children, and flocks of cattle, representing towns of adventurers.</p>

  <p>We looked anxiously forward to the approach of evening, with a sense of
    relief, after the excessive heat of the day.</p>

  <p>Our journey had been pleasant, but toilsome, for we had been long weeks
    on the road.</p>

  <p>Slowly our wagons wound through the timber that skirted the Little Box
    Elder, and, crossing the stream, we ascended the opposite bank.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">20</span></p>

  <p>We had no thought of danger or timid misgivings on the subject of
    savages, for our fears had been all dispersed by constantly received
    assurances of their friendliness.</p>

  <p>At the outposts and ranches, we heard nothing but ridicule of their
    pretensions to warfare, and at Fort Laramie, where information that
    should have been reliable was given us, we had renewed assurances of
    the safety of the road and friendliness of the Indians.</p>

  <p>At Horseshoe Creek, which we had just left, and where there was a
    telegraph station, our inquiries had elicited similar assurances as to
    the quiet and peaceful state of the country through which we must pass.</p>

  <p>Being thus persuaded that fears were groundless, we entertained none,
    and, as I have mentioned before, our small company preferred to travel
    alone on account of the greater progress made in that way.</p>

  <p>The beauty of the sunset and the scenery around us filled our hearts
    with joy, and Mr. Wakefield’s voice was heard in song for the last
    time, as he sang, “Ho! for Idaho.” Little Mary’s low, sweet voice, too,
    joined in the chorus. She was so happy in her childish glee on that
    day, as she always was. She was the star and joy of our whole party.</p>

  <p>We wended our way peacefully and cheerfully on, without a thought of
    the danger that was lying like a tiger in ambush in our path.</p>

  <p>Without a sound of preparation or a word of warning, <span class="pagenum">21</span>the bluffs before
    us were covered with a party of about two hundred and fifty Indians,
    painted and equipped for war, who uttered the wild war-whoop and fired
    a signal volley of guns and revolvers into the air.</p>

  <p>This terrible and unexpected apparition came upon us with such
    startling swiftness that we had not time to think before the main body
    halted and sent out a part of their force, which circled us round at
    regular intervals, but some distance from our wagons. Recovering from
    the shock, our men instantly resolved on defense, and corralled the
    wagons. My husband was looked upon as leader, as he was principal owner
    of the train. Without regard to the insignificance of our numbers, Mr.
    Kelly was ready to stand his ground; but, with all the power I could
    command, I entreated him to forbear and only attempt conciliation. “If
    you fire one shot,” I said, “I feel sure you will seal our fate, as
    they seem to outnumber us ten to one, and will at once massacre all of
    us.”</p>

  <p>Love for the trembling little girl at my side, my husband, and friends,
    made me strong to protest against any thing that would lessen our
    chance for escape with our lives. Poor little Mary! from the first she
    had entertained an ungovernable dread of the Indians, a repugnance
    that could not be overcome, although in our intercourse with friendly
    savages, I had endeavored to show how unfounded it was, and persuade
    her that they were civil and harmless, but all in vain. Mr.<span class="pagenum">22</span> Kelly
    bought her beads and many little presents from them which she much
    admired, but she would always add, “They look so cross at me and they
    have knives and tomahawks, and I fear they will kill me.” Could it be
    that her tender young mind had some presentiment or warning of her
    horrid fate?</p>

  <p>My husband advanced to meet the chief and demand his intentions.</p>

  <p>The savage leader immediately came toward him, riding forward and
    uttering the words, “How! how!” which are understood to mean a friendly
    salutation.</p>

  <p>His name was Ottawa, and he was a war chief of the Ogalalla band of the
    Sioux nation. He struck himself on his breast, saying, “Good Indian,
    me,” and pointing to those around him, he continued, “Heap good Indian,
    hunt buffalo and deer.” He assured us of his utmost friendship for the
    white people; then he shook hands, and his band followed his example,
    crowding around our wagons, shaking us all by the hand over and over
    again, until our arms ached, and grinning and nodding with every
    demonstration of good will.</p>

  <p>Our only policy seemed to be temporizing, in hope of assistance
    approaching; and, to gain time, we allowed them unopposed to do
    whatever they fancied. First, they said they would like to change one
    of their horses for the one Mr. Kelly was riding, a favorite race
    horse. Very much against his will, he acceded to their<span class="pagenum">23</span> request, and
    gave up to them the noble animal to which he was fondly attached.</p>

  <p>My husband came to me with words of cheer and hope, but oh! what a
    marked look of despair was upon his face, such as I had never seen
    before.</p>

  <p>The Indians asked for flour, and we gave them what they wanted of
    provisions. The flour they emptied upon the ground, saving only the
    sack. They talked to us partly by signs and partly in broken English,
    with which some of them were quite familiar, and as we were anxious
    to suit ourselves to their whims and preserve a friendly intercourse
    as long as possible, we allowed them to take whatever they desired,
    and offered them many presents besides. It was, as I have said
    before, extremely warm weather, but they remarked that the cold made
    it necessary for them to look for clothing, and begged for some from
    our stock, which was granted without the slightest offered objection
    on our part. I, in a careless-like manner, said they must give me
    some moccasins for some articles of clothing that I had just handed
    them, and very pleasantly a young Indian gave me a nice pair, richly
    embroidered with different colored beads.</p>

  <p>Our anxiety to conciliate them increased every moment, for the hope of
    help arriving from some quarter grew stronger as they dallied, and,
    alas! it was our only one.</p>

  <p>They grew bolder and more insolent in their advances. <span class="pagenum">24</span>One of them laid
    hold of my husband’s gun, but, being repulsed, desisted.</p>

  <p>The chief at last intimated that he desired us to proceed on our way,
    promising that we should not be molested. We obeyed, without trusting
    them, and soon the train was again in motion, the Indians insisting
    on driving our herd, and growing ominously familiar. Soon my husband
    called a halt. He saw that we were approaching a rocky glen, in whose
    gloomy depths he anticipated a murderous attack, and from which escape
    would be utterly impossible. Our enemies urged us still forward, but we
    resolutely refused to stir, when they requested that we should prepare
    supper, which they said they would share with us, and then go to the
    hills to sleep. The men of our party concluded it best to give them a
    feast. Mr. Kelly gave orders to our two colored servants to prepare at
    once to make a feast for the Indians.</p>

  <p>Andy said, “I think, if I knows any thing about it, they’s had their
    supper;” as they had been eating sugar crackers from our wagons for an
    hour or more.</p>

  <p>The two colored men had been slaves among the Cherokees, and knew the
    Indian character by experience. Their fear and horror of them was
    unbounded, and their terror seemed pitiable to us, as they had worked
    for us a long time, and were most faithful, trustworthy servants.</p>

  <p>Each man was busy preparing the supper; Mr.<span class="pagenum">25</span> Larimer and Frank were
    making the fire; Mr. Wakefield was getting provisions out of the wagon;
    Mr. Taylor was attending to his team; Mr. Kelly and Andy were out
    some distance gathering wood; Mr. Sharp was distributing sugar among
    the Indians; supper, that they asked for, was in rapid progress of
    preparation, when suddenly our terrible enemies threw off their masks
    and displayed their truly demoniac natures. There was a simultaneous
    discharge of arms, and when the cloud of smoke cleared away, I could
    see the retreating form of Mr. Larimer and the slow motion of poor Mr.
    Wakefield, for he was mortally wounded.</p>

  <p>Mr. Kelly and Andy made a miraculous escape with their lives. Mr. Sharp
    was killed within a few feet of me. Mr. Taylor&mdash;I never can forget
    his face as I saw him shot through the forehead with a rifle ball. He
    looked at me as he fell backward to the ground a corpse. I was the last
    object that met his dying gaze. Our poor faithful Frank fell at my feet
    pierced by many arrows. I recall the scene with a sickening horror.
    I could not see my husband anywhere, and did not know his fate, but
    feared and trembled. With a glance at my surroundings, my senses seemed
    gone for a time, but I could only live and endure.</p>

  <p>I had but little time for thought, for the Indians quickly sprang into
    our wagons, tearing off covers, breaking, crushing, and smashing all
    hinderances to<span class="pagenum">26</span> plunder, breaking open locks, trunks, and boxes, and
    distributing or destroying our goods with great rapidity, using their
    tomahawks to pry open boxes, which they split up in savage recklessness.</p>

  <p>Oh, what horrible sights met my view! Pen is powerless to portray
    the scenes occurring around me. They filled the air with the fearful
    war-whoops and hideous shouts. I endeavored to keep my fears quiet as
    possible, knowing that an indiscreet act on my part might result in
    jeopardizing our lives, though I felt certain that we two helpless
    women would share death by their hands; but with as much of an air of
    indifference as I could command, I kept still, hoping to prolong our
    lives, even if but a few moments. I was not allowed this quiet but a
    moment, when two of the most savage-looking of the party rushed up into
    my wagon, with tomahawks drawn in their right hands, and with their
    left seized me by both hands and pulled me violently to the ground,
    injuring my limbs very severely, almost breaking them, from the effects
    of which I afterward suffered a great deal. I turned to my little Mary,
    who, with outstretched hands, was standing in the wagon, took her in my
    arms and helped her to the ground. I then turned to the chief, put my
    hand upon his arm, and implored his protection for my fellow-prisoner
    and our children. At first he gave me no hope, but seemed utterly
    indifferent to my prayers. Partly in words and partly by signs, he<span class="pagenum">27</span>
    ordered me to remain quiet, placing his hand upon his revolver, that
    hung in a belt at his side, as an argument to enforce obedience.</p>

  <p>A short distance in the rear of our train a wagon was in sight. The
    chief immediately dispatched a detachment of his band to capture or
    to cut it off from us, and I saw them ride furiously off in pursuit
    of the small party, which consisted only of one family and a man who
    rode in advance of the single wagon. The horseman was almost instantly
    surrounded and killed by a volley of arrows. The husband of the family
    quickly turned his team around and started them at full speed, gave the
    whip and lines to his wife, who held close in her arms her youngest
    child. He then went to the back end of his wagon and threw out boxes,
    trunks, every thing that he possessed. His wife meantime gave all
    her mind and strength to urging the horses forward on their flight
    from death. The Indians had by this time come very near, so that they
    riddled the wagon-cover with bullets and arrows, one passing through
    the sleeve of the child’s dress in its mother’s arms, but doing it no
    personal injury.</p>

  <p>The terrified man kept the Indians at bay with his revolver, and
    finally they left him and rode furiously back to the scene of the
    murder of our train.</p>

    <div class="subhead">MY HUSBAND’S ESCAPE&mdash;BURIAL OF THE DEAD&mdash;ARRIVAL OF THE SURVIVORS
      AT DEER CREEK&mdash;AN ILL-TIMED BALL.</div>
  </div>

  <p><span class="smcap">When</span> the Indians fired their fatal volley into the midst of our
    little company, while yet they were preparing to entertain them with
    a hospitable supper, my husband was some distance from the scene of
    horror; but, startled by the unexpected report, he hurriedly glanced
    around, saw the pale, terror-stricken faces of his wife and child,
    and the fall of Rev. Mr. Sharp from the wagon, while in the act of
    reaching for sugar and other articles of food with which to conciliate
    our savage guests. The hopelessness of the situation struck a chill
    to his heart. Having laid down his gun to assist in the preparation
    of the feast, the utter futility of contending single-handed against
    such a host of infuriated demons was too apparent. His only hope, and
    that a slight one indeed, was that the Indians might spare the lives of
    his wife and child, to obtain a ransom. In this hope he resolved upon
    efforts for the preservation of his own life, that he might afterward
    <span class="pagenum">29</span>put forth efforts for our rescue, either by pursuit and strategy, or
    by purchase.</p>

  <p>He was shot at, and the barbed arrows whizzed past him, some passing
    through his clothing. He saw Mr. Wakefield fall, and knew that he was
    wounded, if not killed. Mr. Larimer passed him in his flight for life
    toward some neighboring timber.</p>

  <p>Mr. Kelly then ran for some tall grass and sage brush, where he
    concealed himself, favored by the fast approaching darkness. Scarcely
    daring to breathe, his mind tortured with agonizing fears for the fate
    of his wife and child, he seemed to hear from them the cry for help,
    and at one time resolved to rush to their rescue, or die with them;
    any fate seemed better than such torturing doubt. But, realizing at
    last the utter hopelessness of an attempt at rescue, and knowing that
    it was a custom of the Indians, sometimes, to spare the lives of white
    women and children taken captive, for ransom, he again resolved, if
    possible, to save his own life, that he might devote all his energies,
    and the remnant of fortune the savages had not despoiled him of, to the
    accomplishment of the rescue of his wife and child.</p>

  <p>Lying in his perilous shelter, he saw darkness creep slowly around the
    hills, closing on the scene of murder and devastation, like a curtain
    of mercy dropped to shut out a hideous sight. He heard the noise of
    breaking and crashing boxes, and the voices of the<span class="pagenum">30</span> Indians calling
    to each other; then came the culmination of his awful suspense. The
    Indians had again mounted their horses, and, raising the terrible war
    song, chanted its ominous notes as they took their way across the
    hills, carrying his yearning thoughts with them. Pen is powerless to
    portray the agony, to him, of those fearful moments.</p>

  <p>Still fearing to move in the darkness, he distinguished footsteps
    near him, and knew by the stealthy tread that they were those of
    an Indian. In breathless silence he crouched close to the ground,
    fearing each instant the descent of the tomahawk and the gleam of the
    scalping-knife, when, strange to say, a venomous reptile came to his
    rescue, and his enemy fled before it. A huge rattlesnake, one of the
    many with which that region is infested, raised its curved neck close
    beside him, and, thrusting forth its poisonous fangs, gave a warning
    rattle. The prowling Indian took alarm at the sound; other snakes,
    roused for the safety of their young in the dens around, repeated
    it, and the savage, knowing it would be death to venture further,
    retreated, leaving my husband in safety where he had taken refuge; for,
    although he must have lain close to the noisome reptile, he received
    no hurt, and the greater horror of his human foe rendered him almost
    indifferent to the dangers of his surroundings.</p>

  <p>Cautiously he crawled out of the weeds and grass,<span class="pagenum">31</span> and, rising to his
    feet unharmed, started swiftly in an eastward direction. He had to go
    far out in the hills to avoid the savages, and, after traveling many
    miles around, he at last reached the large train, with which the small
    party I had seen pursued had previously taken refuge.</p>

  <p>They were already consolidating with other trains for defense, and
    would not venture to join Mr. Kelly, although he earnestly implored
    assistance to go out in aid of his friends and family, if any of them
    should be left alive.</p>

  <p>The colored man, Andy, soon after joined them. He came in running and
    in great excitement, and was about to report all the company killed,
    when he joyfully discovered Mr. Kelly.</p>

  <p>Great consternation and alarm had spread with the tidings of the
    massacre, and fears for personal safety prevented any one from joining
    my unhappy husband in efforts to rescue his wife and child, or succor
    his missing companions.</p>

  <p>The train did not move forward until re-enforced by many others along
    the road; and even then every precaution was taken to secure safety and
    prevent a surprise. Women in many instances drove the teams, to prevent
    their husbands or fathers being taken at a disadvantage; weapons were
    in every man’s hands, and vigilant eyes were fixed on every bluff or
    gorge, anticipating attack.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">32</span></p>

  <p>A little time and travel brought them to the first scene of murder,
    where they found the dead body of the companion of the man who so
    narrowly escaped with his family. They placed the body in a wagon, and
    proceeded to the dreaded spot where the slaughter of our party had
    occurred.</p>

  <p>The wagons still were standing, and feathers, flour, the remnants of
    much that was but half destroyed, lay scattered about the ground.</p>

  <p>Mr. Kelly, with faltering steps, supported by the strong arm of Andy,
    was among the first to search the spot; his intense distress for the
    unknown fate of his family urged him on, although he dreaded to think
    of what the bloody spot might disclose to him.</p>

  <p>The dead bodies of Mr. Sharp, Mr. Taylor, and our colored servant,
    Franklin, were discovered lying where they had fallen. Poor Frank
    had been shot by an arrow that pierced both his legs, pinning them
    together, in which condition he had been murdered by the ruthless
    wretches by having his skull broken.</p>

  <p>Both Mr. Sharp and Mr. Taylor left large families at home to mourn
    their loss. Mr. Larimer came up with an arrow wound in one of his
    limbs. He had passed the night in trying to elude his savage pursuers,
    and was very tired and exhausted, and very much distressed about his
    wife and son, a robust little fellow of eight or nine years.</p>

  <p>But Mr. Wakefield was nowhere to be seen. After<span class="pagenum">33</span> searching the
    brushwood for some time, and a quarter of a mile distant from the
    scene of attack, they discovered him still alive, but pierced by
    three arrows that he had vainly endeavored to extract, succeeding
    only in withdrawing the shafts, but leaving the steel points still
    deeply imbedded in the flesh. Mr. Kelly took him and cared for him
    with all the skill and kindness possible. No brothers could have been
    more tenderly attached to each other than they. He then procured as
    comfortable a conveyance as he could for them, and picked up a few
    relics from our demolished train. Among them was a daily journal of our
    trip, from the time we were married until the hour that the Indians
    came upon us. This he prized, as he said, more than he did his life.</p>

  <p>The next thing that was necessary to do, after the wounded were cared
    for, was to bury the dead, and a wide grave was dug and the four bodies
    solemnly consigned, uncoffined, to the earth. A buffalo robe was placed
    above them, and then the earth was piled on their unconscious breasts.</p>

  <p>At that time the question of color had occasioned much dissension, and
    controversy ran high as to the propriety of allowing the colored people
    the privilege of sitting beside their white brethren. Poor Franklin had
    shared death with our companions, and was not deemed unworthy to share
    the common grave of his fellow victims. They lie together in the valley
    of<span class="pagenum">34</span> Little Box Elder, where with saddened hearts our friends left
    them, thinking of the high hopes and fearless energy with which they
    had started on their journey, each feeling secure in the success that
    awaited them, and never, for a moment, dreaming of the grave in the
    wilderness that was to close over them and their earthly hopes. They
    were buried on the desolate plain, a thousand miles away from their
    loved wives and children, who bemoan their sad, untimely fate.</p>

  <p>Mr. Kelly found part of his herd of cattle grazing near by; Mr. Sharp’s
    were still tied to the stake where he had carefully secured them. The
    Indians had taken our horses, but left the cattle, as they do when they
    are on the war path, or unless they need meat for present use. They
    shot some of them, however, and left them to decay upon the plain. Many
    arrows were scattered upon the ground, their peculiar marks showing
    that their owners had all belonged to one tribe, though of different
    bands. They were similar in form and finish; the shafts were round and
    three feet long, grooved on their sides, that the blood of the victim
    might not be impeded in its outward flow; each had three strips of
    feathers attached to its top, about seven inches in length, and, on the
    other end, a steel point, fastened lightly, so as to be easily detached
    in the flesh it penetrates. The depth of the wound depends on the
    distance of the aim, but they sometimes pass quite through the body,<span class="pagenum">35</span>
    though usually their force is exhausted in entering a few inches beyond
    the point.</p>

  <p>The wounded being made as comfortable as circumstances would allow, the
    train left the spot in the evening, and moved forward to an encampment
    a mile distant from the sad place, where the journey of our lost
    companions had ended forever, whose visions of the golden land must be
    a higher and brighter one than earthly eyes can claim.</p>

  <p>Early next day the travelers arrived at Deer Creek Fort, where Mr.
    Kelly found medical aid for the wounded, and procured a tent to shelter
    them, and devoted himself to alleviating their sufferings, and, with
    the assistance of the kind people of the fort, succeeded in arranging
    them in tolerable comfort.</p>

  <p>Captain Rhineheart was commanding officer at Deer Creek, and ordered
    the property of the deceased to be delivered over to him, which Mr.
    Kelly did.</p>

  <p>The story of the attack and massacre had traveled faster than the
    sufferers from its barbarity. The garrison had learned it before the
    train arrived, through some soldiers returning from Fort Laramie, where
    they had been to receive money from the paymaster, who had heard an
    account of the attack on the road, and had a passing glimpse of the
    terrible field of slaughter.</p>

  <p>The evening that the large train arrived at the fort, the officers gave
    a ball, and the emigrant women were<span class="pagenum">36</span> invited, from the trains camped in
    the vicinity, to join in these inappropriately timed festivities.</p>

  <p>The mother of the child, who had so narrowly escaped death, having lost
    her own wardrobe in her efforts to escape the pursuit of the Indians,
    borrowed a dress from a lady who resided at the fort, and attended the
    entertainment, dancing and joining in the gaieties, when the burial of
    their companion and our poor men had just been completed, and the heavy
    cloud of our calamity had so lately shrouded them in gloom. Such are
    the effects of isolation from social and civil influence, and contact
    with danger, and familiarity with terror and death.</p>

  <p>People grow reckless, and often lose the gentle sympathies that
    alleviate suffering, from frequent intercourse with it in its worst
    forms.</p>

    <h2 class="nobreak gespertt2" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</h2>
    <div class="subheadc">BEGINNING OF MY CAPTIVITY.</div>
  </div>

  <p><span class="smcap">The</span> facts related in the preceding chapter concerning matters occurring
    in Mr. Kelly’s experience, and adventures after the attack upon our
    train, were related to me after my restoration to freedom and my
    husband, by him.</p>

  <p>I now return to the narration of my own terrible experiences.</p>

  <p>I was led a short distance from the wagon, with Mary, and told to
    remain quiet, and tried to submit; but oh, what a yearning sprang up in
    my heart to escape, as I hoped my husband had done! But many watchful
    eyes were upon me, and enemies on every side, and I realized that any
    effort then at escape would result in failure, and probably cause the
    death of all the prisoners.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Larimer, with her boy, came to us, trembling with fear, saying,
    “The men have all escaped, and left us to the mercy of the savages.”</p>

  <p>In reply, I said, “I do hope they have. What benefit would it be to us,
    to have them here, to suffer<span class="pagenum">38</span> this fear and danger with us? They would
    be killed, and then all hope of rescue for us would be at an end.”</p>

  <p>Her agitation was extreme. Her grief seemed to have reached its climax
    when she saw the Indians destroying her property, which consisted
    principally of such articles as belong to the Daguerrean art. She had
    indulged in high hopes of fortune from the prosecution of this art
    among the mining towns of Idaho. As she saw her chemicals, picture
    cases, and other property pertaining to her calling, being destroyed,
    she uttered such a wild despairing cry as brought the chief of the band
    to us, who, with gleaming knife, threatened to end all her further
    troubles in this world. The moment was a critical one for her. The
    Indians were flushed with an easy-won victory over a weak party; they
    had “tasted blood,” and it needed but slight provocation for them to
    shed that even of defenseless women and children.</p>

  <p>My own agony could be no less than that of my companion in misfortune.
    The loss of our worldly possessions, which were not inconsiderable,
    consisting of a large herd of cattle, and groceries, and goods of
    particular value in the mining regions, I gave no thought to. The
    possible fate of my husband; the dark, fearful future that loomed
    before myself and little Mary, for whose possible future I had more
    apprehension than for my own, were thoughts that<span class="pagenum">39</span> flashed through my
    mind to the exclusion of all mere pecuniary considerations.</p>

  <p>But my poor companion was in great danger, and perhaps it was a selfish
    thought of future loneliness in captivity which induced me to intercede
    that her life might be spared. I went to the side of the chief, and,
    assuming a cheerfulness I was very far from feeling, plead successfully
    for her life.</p>

  <p>I endeavored in every way to propitiate our savage captor, but received
    no evidences of kindness or relenting that I could then understand. He
    did present me, however, a wreath of gay feathers from his own head,
    which I took, regarding it merely as an ornament, when in reality, as I
    afterward learned, it was a token of his favor and protection.</p>

  <p>He then left us, to secure his own share of plunder, but we saw that
    we were surrounded by a special guard of armed men, and so gave up all
    struggle against what seemed an inevitable doom, and sat down upon the
    ground in despair.</p>

  <p>I know now that night had come upon us while we sat there, and that
    darkness was closing the scene of desolation and death before their
    arrangements for departure were completed.</p>

  <p>The first intimation we had that our immediate massacre was not
    intended, was a few articles of clothing presented by a young Indian,
    whose name was Wechela, who intimated that we would have need for them.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">40</span></p>

  <p>It was a pitiable sight to see the terrified looks of our helpless
    children, who clung to us for the protection we could not give. Mrs.
    Larimer was unconscious of the death of any of our party. I did not
    tell her what my eyes had seen, fearing that she could not endure it,
    but strove to encourage and enliven her, lest her excitement would
    hasten her death or excite the anger of our captors.</p>

  <p>We both feared that when the Indians made their arrangements for
    departure we would be quickly disposed of by the scalping knife; or
    even should we escape for the time, we saw no prospect of release
    from bondage. Terror of the most appalling nature for the fate of the
    children possessed me, and all the horrors of Indian captivity that we
    had ever heard crowded on our minds with a new and fearful meaning&mdash;the
    slow fires, the pitiless knife, the poisoned arrows, the torture of
    famine, and a thousand nameless phantoms of agony passed before our
    troubled souls, filling us with fears so harrowing that the pangs of
    dissolution compared to them must have been relief.</p>

  <p>It may be thought almost impossible in such a chaos of dread to collect
    the soul in prayer, but</p>

      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">When woe is come, the soul is dumb</div>
        <div class="i0">That crieth not to God,</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">and the only respite we could claim from despair was the lifting of our
    trembling hearts upward to the God of mercy.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">41</span></p>

  <p>Those hours of misery can never be forgotten. We were oppressed by
    terrors we could not explain or realize. The sudden separation from
    those we loved and relied on; our own helplessness and the gloom of
    uncertainty that hung over the future&mdash;surely none can better testify
    to the worth of trust in God than those whose hope on earth seemed
    ended; and, faint and weak as our faith was, it saved us from utter
    desolation and the blackness of despair.</p>

  <p>From among the confused mass of material of all kinds scattered about,
    the same young Indian, Wechela, brought me a pair of shoes; also a pair
    of little Mary’s. He looked kindly as he laid these articles before me,
    intimating by his gestures that our lives were to be spared, and that
    we should have need of them and other clothing during our long march
    into captivity. He also brought me some books and letters, all of which
    I thankfully received. I readily conceived a plan to make good use of
    them, and secreted as many as I could about my clothing. I said to Mrs.
    Larimer, “If I can retain these papers and letters, and we are forced
    to travel with the Indians into their unknown country, I shall drop
    them at intervals along the way we are taken, as a guide, and trust
    in God that our friends may find and follow them to our rescue, or if
    an opportunity of escape offer, we will seize it, and by their help
    retrace our steps.”</p>

  <p>The property that the Indians could not carry with<span class="pagenum">42</span> them, they gathered
    into a pile and lighted. The light of the flames showed us the forms
    of our captors busily loading their horses and ours with plunder, and
    preparing to depart. When their arrangements were completed, they came
    to us and signified that we must accompany them, pointing to the horses
    they led up to us, and motioning for us to mount. The horse assigned to
    me was one that had belonged to Mr. Larimer, and was crippled in the
    back. This I endeavored to make them understand, but failed.</p>

  <p>This was the first reliable assurance they gave us that our lives were
    not in immediate danger, and we received it gratefully, for with the
    prospect of life hope revived, and faith to believe that God had not
    forsaken us, and that we might yet be united to our friends, who never
    seemed dearer than when we were about to be carried into captivity by
    the hostile sons of the forest.</p>

  <p>Many persons have since assured me that, to them, death would have been
    preferable to life with such prospects, saying that rather than have
    submitted to be carried away by savages, to a dark and doubtful doom,
    they would have taken their own lives. But it is only those who have
    looked over the dark abyss of death who know how the soul shrinks from
    meeting the unknown future.</p>

  <p>Experience is a grand teacher, and we were then in her school, and
    learned that while hope offers the<span class="pagenum">43</span> faintest token of refuge, we pause
    upon the fearful brink of eternity, and look back for rescue.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Larimer had climbed into her saddle, her boy placed behind her
    on the same horse, and started on, accompanied by a party of Indians.
    I also climbed into my saddle, but was no sooner there than the horse
    fell to the ground, and I under him, thus increasing the bruises I had
    already received, and causing me great pain. This accident detained me
    some time in the rear. A dread of being separated from the only white
    woman in that awful wilderness filled me with horror.</p>

  <p>Soon they had another horse saddled for me, and assisted me to mount
    him. I looked around for my little Mary. There she stood, a poor
    helpless lamb, in the midst of blood-thirsty savages. I stretched out
    my arms for her imploringly. For a moment they hesitated; then, to my
    unspeakable joy, they yielded, and gave me my child. They then started
    on, leading my horse; they also gave me a rope that was fastened around
    the horse’s under jaw.</p>

  <p>The air was cool, and the sky was bright with the glitter of starlight.
    The water, as it fell over the rocks in the distance, came to our eager
    ears with a faint, pleasant murmur. All nature seemed peaceful and
    pitiless in its calm repose, unconscious of our desolate misery; the
    cry of night-birds and chirp of insects came with painful distinctness
    as we turned to leave the valley of Little Box Elder.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">44</span></p>

  <p>Straining my eyes, I sought to penetrate the shadows of the woods where
    our fugitive friends might be hid. The smoldering ruins of our property
    fell into ashes and the smoke faded away; night had covered the traces
    of confusion and struggle with her shrouding mantle, and all seemed
    quiet and unbroken peace.</p>

  <p>I turned for a last look, and even the smoke was gone; the solemn
    trees, the rippling water, the soft night wind and the starlight, told
    no tale of the desolation and death that had gone before; and I rode on
    in my helpless condition, with my child clinging to me, without guide
    or support, save my trust in God.</p>

    <div class="subhead">PLAN FOR LITTLE MARY’S ESCAPE&mdash;TORTURES OF
      UNCERTAINTY&mdash;UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE.</div>
  </div>

  <p><span class="smcap">The</span> Indians left the scene of their cruel rapacity, traveling
    northward, chanting their monotonous war song. After a ride of two
    miles, through tall weeds and bushes, we left the bottom lands, and
    ascended some bluffs, and soon after came to a creek, which was easily
    forded, and where the Indians quenched their thirst.</p>

  <p>The hills beyond began to be more difficult to ascend, and the gorges
    seemed fearfully deep, as we looked into the black shadows unrelieved
    by the feeble light of the stars.</p>

  <p>In the darkness of our ride, I conceived a plan for the escape of
    little Mary.</p>

  <p>I whispered in her childish ear, “Mary, we are only a few miles from
    our camp, and the stream we have crossed you can easily wade through.
    I have dropped letters on the way, you know, to guide our friends in
    the direction we have taken; they will guide you back again, and it may
    be your only chance of escape from<span class="pagenum">46</span> destruction. Drop gently down, and
    lie on the ground for a little while, to avoid being seen; then retrace
    your steps, and may God in mercy go with you. If I can, I will follow
    you.”</p>

  <p>The child, whose judgment was remarkable for her age, readily acceded
    to this plan; her eye brightened and her young heart throbbed as she
    thought of its success.</p>

  <p>Watching the opportunity, I dropped her gently, carefully, and
    unobserved, to the ground, and she lay there, while the Indians pursued
    their way, unconscious of their loss.</p>

  <p>To portray my feelings upon this separation would be impossible. The
    agony I suffered was indescribable. I was firmly convinced that my
    course was wise&mdash;that I had given her the only chance of escape within
    my power; yet the terrible uncertainty of what her fate might be in the
    way before her, was almost unbearable.</p>

  <p>I continued to think of it so deeply that at last I grew desperate,
    and resolved to follow her at every risk. Accordingly, watching an
    opportunity, I, too, slipped to the ground under the friendly cover of
    night, and the horse went on without its rider.</p>

  <p>My plan was not successful. My flight was soon discovered, and the
    Indian wheeled around and rode back in my pursuit. Crouching in the
    undergrowth I might have escaped in the darkness, were it not for their
    cunning. Forming in a line of forty or fifty<span class="pagenum">47</span> abreast, they actually
    covered the ground as they rode past me.</p>

  <p>The horses themselves were thus led to betray me, for, being frightened
    at my crouching form, they stopped and reared, thus informing them of
    my hiding-place.</p>

  <p>With great presence of mind I arose the moment I found myself
    discovered, and relating my story, the invention of an instant, I
    succeeded partially in allaying their anger.</p>

  <p>I told them the child had fallen asleep and dropped from the horse;
    that I had endeavored to call their attention to it, but in vain; and,
    fearing I would be unable to find her if we rode further, I had jumped
    down and attempted the search alone.</p>

  <p>The Indians used great violence toward me, assuring me that if
    any further attempts were made to escape, my punishment would be
    accordingly.</p>

  <p>They then promised to send a party out in search of the child when it
    became light.</p>

  <p>Poor little Mary! alone in the wilderness, a little, helpless child;
    who can portray her terror!</p>

  <p>With faith to trust, and courage to dare, that little, trembling form
    through the long hours of the night kept watch.</p>

  <p>The lonely cry of the night-bird had no fear in its melancholy scream
    for the little wanderer who crouched amid the prairie grass. The baying
    of the gray wolf,<span class="pagenum">48</span> as he passed the lonely watcher, might startle, but
    could not drive the faith from her heart.</p>

  <p>Surely God is just, and angels will guide the faltering feet to friends
    and home. Innocent of wrong, how could she but trust that the unseen
    hands of spirits would guide her from the surrounding perils!</p>

      THIRST AND WEARINESS&mdash;DISAPPEARANCE OF MY FELLOW PRISONER&mdash;LOSS
      OF THE OLD CHIEF’S PIPE AND ITS CONSEQUENCES TO ME&mdash;A SCENE OF TERROR.</div>
  </div>

  <p><span class="smcap">To</span> take up the thread of my own narrative again, and the continuation
    of my journey with the savages, after the never-to-be-forgotten night
    when I parted with little Mary, and the attempt to escape myself will
    be to entertain my reader with a sight of the dangerous and precipitous
    paths among the great bluffs which we had been approaching, and the
    dizzy, fearful heights leading over the dark abyss, or the gloomy,
    terrible gorge, where only an Indian dares to venture.</p>

  <p>The blackness of night, and the dread of our savage companions, added
    terror to this perilous ride. As we passed the little creek before we
    plunged into these rocky fastnesses, we had left some scattered woods
    along its banks.</p>

  <p>I remember looking longingly at the dim shelter of these friendly
    trees, and being possessed by an almost uncontrollable desire to
    leap from the horse and dare my fate in endeavoring to reach their
    protecting shade;<span class="pagenum">50</span> but the Indians’ rifles behind me, and my dread of
    instant death, restrained me. And now my attention was attracted by the
    wild and terrible scenery around us, through which our fearful captors
    rode at ease, although it seemed impossible for man or beast to retain
    a footing over such craggy peaks and through such rugged ravines.</p>

  <p>The cool air and the sound of rippling water warned us of our nearness
    to a river; and soon the savages turned their horses down a steep
    declivity that, like a mighty wall, closed in the great bed of the
    North Platte.</p>

  <p>I saw that the river was rapid and deep, but we crossed the sands,
    plunged in, and braved the current.</p>

  <p>From the child to my husband was an easy transition; indeed, when I
    thought of one, the other was presently in my mind; and to mark the
    path of our retreat with the letters and papers I dropped on our way
    seemed the only hope I had of his being able to come to my rescue.</p>

  <p>As the horses plunged into the swelling river I secretly dropped
    another letter, that, I prayed, might be a clue to the labyrinth
    through which we were being led; for I could see by all the Indians’
    precautions, that to mislead any who should have the temerity to
    attempt our recovery, was the design of their movements.</p>

  <p>They had taken paths inaccessible to white men, and made their crossing
    at a point where it would be<span class="pagenum">51</span> impossible for trains to pass, so that
    they might avoid meeting emigrants. Having reached the opposite bank
    they separated into squads, and started in every direction, except
    southward, so as to mislead or confuse pursuers by the various trails.</p>

  <p>The band that surrounded and directed us kept to the northward a little
    by west. I tried to keep the points of compass clearly, because it
    seemed part of the hope that sustained me.</p>

  <p>Mr. Kelly had said that our position on the Little Box Elder was about
    twelve miles from Deer Creek Station, which lay to the northwest of
    us. Marking our present course, I tried, by calculating the distance,
    to keep that position in my mind, for toward it my yearning desire for
    help and relief turned.</p>

  <p>After crossing the river and issuing from the bluffs we came to a
    bright, cool stream of water in a lovely valley, which ran through its
    bosom, spreading a delicious freshness all around.</p>

  <p>Brilliant flowers opened their gorgeous cups to the coming sunshine,
    and delicate blossoms hid themselves among the rich shrubbery and at
    the mossy roots of grand old trees.</p>

  <p>The awakening birds soared upward with loud and joyful melodies, and
    nature rejoiced at approaching day.</p>

  <p>The beauty and loveliness of the scene mocked my sleepless eyes, and
    despair tugged at my heart-strings;<span class="pagenum">52</span> still I made superhuman efforts
    to appear cheerful, for my only refuge was in being submissive and
    practicing conciliation. My fear of them was too powerful to allow me
    to give way to emotion for one moment.</p>

  <p>There were sentinels stationed at different places to give the alarm,
    in case of any one approaching to rescue, and I afterward learned that
    in such a case I would have been instantly murdered.</p>

  <p>Next morning I learned, by signs, that Indians had gone out in search
    of little Mary, scattering themselves over the hills, in squads. Those
    remaining were constantly overlooking their plunder and unrolling
    bundles taken from our wagons. They indulged their admiration for their
    spoils in loud conversation.</p>

  <p>The Indians seemed to select, with a clear knowledge of natural beauty,
    such localities as seemed best fitted to suggest refreshment and repose.</p>

  <p>The scenery through which we had passed was wildly grand; it now became
    serenely beautiful, and to a lover of nature, with a mind free from
    fear and anxiety, the whole picture would have been a dream of delight.</p>

  <p>The night of my capture, I was ordered to lie down on the ground,
    near a wounded Indian. A circle of them guarded me, and three fierce
    warriors sat near me with drawn tomahawks.</p>

  <p>Reader, imagine my feelings, after the terrible scenes of the day
    previous; the desolate white woman in the<span class="pagenum">53</span> power of revengeful savages,
    not daring to speak, lest their fury should fall on my defenceless head.</p>

  <p>My great anxiety now was to preserve my sanity, which threatened to be
    overcome if I did not arouse myself to hope, and put aside the feeling
    of despair which at times stole over me. My heart was continually
    lifted to “Our Father,” and confidently I now began to feel that prayer
    would be answered, and that God would deliver me in due season. This
    nerved me to endure and appear submissive.</p>

  <p>At early dawn I was aroused from my apparent slumbers by the war chief,
    who sent me out to catch the horses&mdash;our American horses being afraid
    of the savages&mdash;and as the animals were those belonging to our train,
    it was supposed that I could do so readily.</p>

  <p>Upon returning, my eyes were gladdened by the sight of my fellow
    prisoner, who was seated with her boy upon the ground, eating buffalo
    meat and crackers. I went immediately to her, and we conversed in low
    tones, telling her of my intention to escape the first opportunity. She
    seemed much depressed, but I endeavored to re-assure her, and bidding
    her hope for the best, went back to where the Indians were making
    ropes, and packing their goods and plunder more securely, preparatory
    to the succeeding march, which was commenced at an early hour of the
    day.</p>

  <p>We proceeded on our journey until near noon, when we halted in a valley
    not far to the north of Deer Creek<span class="pagenum">54</span> Station, and I met this lady
    again. It was a clear and beautiful valley where we rested, until the
    scorching rays of the sun had faded in the horizon.</p>

  <p>Being burdened with the gun, and bow and arrow of the chief, my tired
    arms were relieved, and I plead for the privilege of camping here all
    night for many reasons. One was, we might be overtaken by friends sent
    to rescue us, and the distance of return would be less if I should be
    successful in my next attempt to escape.</p>

  <p>My entreaties were unavailing; the savages were determined to go
    forward, and we were soon mounted and started on. We traveled until
    sunset, then camped for the night in a secluded valley; we seemed to
    enter this valley along the base of a wall, composed of bluffs or
    peaks. Within these circling hills it lay, a green, cool resting place,
    watered by a bright sparkling stream, and pleasantly dotted with bushes
    and undergrowth.</p>

  <p>The moon went down early, and in the dim, uncertain star light, the
    heavy bluffs seemed to shut us in on all sides, rising grimly, like
    guardians, over our imprisoned lines. Blankets were spread, and on
    these the Indians rested.</p>

  <p>I was then led out some distance in the camp, and securely fastened
    for the night. But before this, I remarked, to my fellow prisoner, my
    determination to escape that night, if my life were the forfeit, as in
    every wind I fancied I could hear the voice of little Mary calling me.
    She entreated me not to leave her,<span class="pagenum">55</span> but promising help to her should I
    be fortunate enough to get free, I sadly bade her good night, and went
    to my allotted place.</p>

  <p>In the morning, when permitted to rise, I learned that she had
    disappeared. A terrible sense of isolation closed around me. No one can
    realize the sensation without in some measure experiencing it.</p>

  <p>I was desolate before, but now that I knew myself separated from my
    only white companion, the feeling increased tenfold, and seemed to
    weigh me down with its awful gloomy horror.</p>

  <p>In the heart of the wilderness, surrounded by creatures with whom no
    chord of sympathy was entertained&mdash;far from home, friends and the
    interests of civilized life&mdash;the attractions of society, and, above
    all, separated from husband and loved ones&mdash;there seemed but one
    glimpse of light, in all the blackness of despair, left, and that was
    flight.</p>

  <p>I listened to every sound, while moments appeared hours, and it seemed
    to me that death in its most terrible form would not be so hard to bear
    as the torturing agony I then endured.</p>

  <p>I murmured broken prayers. I seemed to hear the voices of my husband
    and child calling me, and springing forward, with a wild belief that it
    was real, would sink back again, overwhelmed with fresh agony.</p>

  <p>Arrangements were then made for resuming our journey, and we were soon
    once more on our march.<span class="pagenum">56</span> Another burden had been added to my almost
    worn-out frame, the leading of an unruly horse; and my arms were so
    full of the implements I was forced to carry, that I threw away the
    pipe of the old chief&mdash;a tube nearly three feet long, and given me to
    take care of&mdash;which was very unfortunate for me, exciting the wrath and
    anger of the chief to a terrible degree.</p>

  <p>Now they seemed to regard me with a suspicious aversion, and were not
    so kind as before.</p>

  <p>The country they passed over was high, dry, and barren. I rode one
    horse and led another; and when evening came they stopped to rest in a
    grove of great timber, where there was a dry creek bed.</p>

  <p>Water was obtained by digging in the sand, but the supply was meager,
    and I was allowed none.</p>

  <p>The sun began to sink, and the chief was so enraged against me, that he
    told me by signs that I should behold it rise no more.</p>

  <p>Grinding his teeth with wrathful anger, he made me understand that I
    was not to be trusted; had once tried to escape; had made them suffer
    the loss of my child, and that my life would be the forfeit.</p>

  <p>A large fire had been built, and they all danced around it. Night had
    begun to darken heavily over me, and I stood trembling and horror
    struck, not knowing but that the flame the savages capered about was
    destined to consume my tortured form.</p>

  <p>The pipe of the chief was nowhere to be found, and<span class="pagenum">57</span> it was demanded of
    me to produce it. He used the Indian words, “Chopa-chanopa,” uttered in
    a voice of thunder, accompanying them with gestures, whose meaning was
    too threatening to be mistaken.</p>

  <p>I looked in fear and dismay around me, utterly at a loss to know what
    was expected, yet dreading the consequences of failing to obey.</p>

  <p>Wechela, the Indian boy, who had been so kind to me, now came up,
    and made the motion of puffing with his lips, to help me; and then I
    remembered that I had broken the pipe the day before, and thrown it
    away, ignorant of their veneration for the pipe, and of its value as a
    peace offering.</p>

  <p>The chief declared that I should die for having caused the loss of his
    pipe.</p>

  <p>An untamed horse was brought, and they told me I would be placed on it
    as a target for their deadliest arrows, and the animal might then run
    at will, carrying my body where it would.</p>

  <p>Helpless, and almost dying with terror at my situation, I sank on a
    rocky seat in their midst. They were all armed, and anxiously awaited
    the signal. They had pistols, bows, and spears; and I noticed some
    stoop, and raise blazing fire-brands to frighten the pawing beast that
    was to bear me to death.</p>

  <p>In speechless agony I raised my soul to God! Soon it would stand before
    his throne, and with all the pleading passion of my sinking soul I
    prayed for<span class="pagenum">58</span> pardon and favor in his precious blood, who had suffered
    for my sins, and risen on high for my justification.</p>

  <p>In an instant a life-time of thought condensed itself into my mind, and
    I could see my old home and hear my mother’s voice; and the contrast
    between the love I had been so ruthlessly torn from, and the hundreds
    of savage faces, gleaming with ferocity and excitement around me,
    seemed like the lights and shadows of some weird picture.</p>

  <p>But I was to die, and I desired, with all the strength of my soul, to
    grasp the promises of God’s mercy, and free my parting spirit from all
    revengeful, earthly thoughts.</p>

  <p>In what I almost felt my final breath, I prayed for my own salvation,
    and the forgiveness of my enemies; and remembering a purse of money
    which was in my pocket, knowing that it would decay with my body in the
    wilderness, I drew it out, and, with suffused eyes, divided it among
    them, though my hands were growing powerless and my sight failing. One
    hundred and twenty dollars in notes I gave them, telling them its value
    as I did so, when, to my astonishment, a change came over their faces.
    They laid their weapons on the ground, seemingly pleased, and anxious
    to understand, requesting me to explain the worth of each note clearly,
    by holding up my fingers.</p>

  <p>Eagerly I tried to obey, perceiving the hope their<span class="pagenum">59</span> milder manner held
    out; but my cold hands fell powerless by my side, my tongue refused
    to utter a sound, and, unconsciously, I sank to the ground utterly
    insensible to objects around me.</p>

  <p>When insensibility gave way to returning feeling, I was still on the
    ground where I had fallen, but preparations for the deadly scene were
    gone, and the savages slumbered on the ground near me by the faint
    firelight. Crawling into a sitting posture, I surveyed the camp, and
    saw hundreds of sleeping forms lying in groups around, with watches
    set in their places, and no opportunity to escape, even if strength
    permitted.</p>

  <p>Weak and trembling, I sank down, and lay silent till day-break, when
    the camp was again put in motion, and, at their bidding, I mounted one
    horse and led another, as I had done on the day previous.</p>

  <p>This was no easy task, for the pack-horse, which had not been broken,
    would frequently pull back so violently as to bring me to the ground,
    at which the chief would become fearfully angry, threatening to kill me
    at once.</p>

  <p>Practicing great caution, and using strong effort, I would strive to
    remain in the saddle to avoid the cuffs and blows received.</p>

  <p>Whenever the bridle would slip inadvertently from my hand, the chief’s
    blasphemous language would all be English; a sad commentary on the
    benefits white men<span class="pagenum">60</span> confer on their savage brethren when brought into
    close contact.</p>

  <p>Drunkenness, profanity, and dissolute habits are the lessons of
    civilization to the red men, and when the weapons we furnish are turned
    against ourselves, their edge is keen indeed.</p>

  <p>Feeling that I had forfeited the good will of the Indians, and knowing
    that the tenure of my life was most uncertain, I dared make no
    complaint, although hunger and devouring thirst tortured me.</p>

  <p>The way still led through dry and sandy hills, upon which the sun
    glared down with exhausting heat, and seemed to scorch life and
    moisture out of all his rays fell upon. As far as my eye could reach,
    nothing but burning sand, and withering sage brush or thorny cactus,
    was to be seen. All my surroundings only served to aggravate the thirst
    which the terrible heat of that long day’s ride increased to frenzy.</p>

  <p>When, in famishing despair I closed my eyes, a cup of cool, delicious
    drink would seem to be presented to my lips, only to be cruelly
    withdrawn; and this torture seemed to me like the agony of the rich
    man, who besought Lazarus for one drop of water to cool his parched
    tongue.</p>

  <p>I thought of all I had been separated from, as it seemed to me,
    forever, and the torment of the hour reduced me to despair. I wished
    to die, feeling that the pangs of dissolution could not surpass the
    anguish<span class="pagenum">61</span> of my living death. My voice was almost gone, and with
    difficulty I maintained my seat in the saddle.</p>

  <p>Turning my eyes despairingly to my captors, I uttered the word “Minne,”
    signifying water in their language, and kept repeating it imploringly
    at intervals. They seemed to hurry forward, and, just at sunset, came
    in sight of a grassy valley through which flowed a river, and the sight
    of it came like hope to my almost dying eyes.</p>

  <p>A little brook from the hills above found its way into the waters of
    this greater stream, and here they dismounted, and, lifting me from my
    horse, laid me in its shallow bed. I had become almost unconscious,
    and the cool, delightful element revived me. At first I was not able
    to drink, but gradually my strength renewed itself, and I found relief
    from the indescribable pangs of thirst.</p>

  <p>The stream by which the Indians camped that night was Powder River; and
    here, in 1866, Fort Conner was built, which in the following year was
    named Fort Reno.</p>

    <div class="subhead">POWDER RIVER&mdash;ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE&mdash;DETECTION AND DESPAIR&mdash;A
      QUARREL&mdash;MY LIFE SAVED BY “JUMPING BEAR.”</div>
  </div>

  <p><span class="smcap">The</span> name given to Powder River by the Indians, is “Chahalee Wacapolah.”
    It crosses the country east of the Big Horn Mountains, and from its
    banks can be seen the snow-capped Cloud Peak rising grandly from its
    surrounding hills. Between these ranges, that culminate in the queenly,
    shining crowned height that takes its name from the clouds it seems
    to pierce, are fertile valleys, in which game abounds, and delicious
    wild fruits in great variety, some of which can not be surpassed by
    cultivated orchard products in the richness and flavor they possess,
    although they ripen in the neighborhood of everlasting snow.</p>

  <p>In these valleys the country seems to roll in gentle slopes, presenting
    to the eye many elements of loveliness and future value.</p>

  <p>Powder River, which is a muddy stream, comes from the southern side of
    the Big Horn Mountains, and takes a southwestern course, and therefore
    is not a part of the bright channel that combines to feed the Missouri
    River from the Big Horn range.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">63</span></p>

  <p>This range of the Rocky Mountains possesses two distinct, marked
    features. First, there is a central or back-bone range, which
    culminates in perpetual snow, where Cloud Peak grandly rises, as the
    chief of all its proud summits. Falling off gradually toward the
    southern valley, there are similar ranges of the Wind River Mountains
    beyond.</p>

  <p>Between these ranges, and varying in breadth from twelve to twenty-five
    miles, are fine hunting grounds, abounding in noble orchards of wild
    fruit of various kinds, and grapes, as well as game of the choicest
    kind for the huntsman. Notwithstanding its vicinity to snow, there are
    gentle slopes which present features of peculiar loveliness.</p>

  <p>Several miles northwest, and following the sweep of the higher northern
    range, and six to eight miles outside its general base, a new country
    opens. Sage brush and cactus, which for nearly two hundred miles have
    so largely monopolized the soil, rapidly disappear.</p>

  <p>The change, though sudden, is very beautiful. One narrow divide only is
    crossed, and the transition about one day’s ride from the above-named
    river. The limpid, transparent, and noisy waters of Deer Fork are
    reached, and the horses have difficulty in breasting the swift current.
    The river is so clear that every pebble and fish is seen distinctly on
    the bottom, and the water so cool that ice in midsummer is no object of
    desire.</p>

  <p>The scenes of natural beauty, and the charms that<span class="pagenum">64</span> have endeared this
    country to the savage, will in the future lure the emigrant seeking a
    home in this new and undeveloped land.</p>

  <p>This clear creek is a genuine outflow from the Big Horn Mountains,
    and is a type of many others, no less pure and valuable, derived from
    melting snow and from innumerable springs in the mountains.</p>

  <p>Rock Creek comes next, with far less pretensions, but is similar in
    character.</p>

  <p>A day’s ride to the northward brings the traveler to Crazy Woman’s Fork.</p>

  <p>This ever-flowing stream receives its yellow hue from the Powder River
    waters, of which it is a branch.</p>

  <p>The country is scarred by countless trails of buffalo, so that what is
    often called the Indian trail is merely the hoof-print of these animals.</p>

  <p>Leaving Powder River, we passed through large pine forests, and through
    valleys rich with beautiful grasses, with limpid springs and seemingly
    eternal verdure.</p>

  <p>I continued to drop papers by the way, hoping they might lead to my
    discovery, which would have proved fatal had any one attempted a
    rescue, as the Indians prefer to kill their captives rather than be
    forced to give them up.</p>

  <p>It was the fifth night of my sojourn with the Indians that I found
    myself under the weeping willows of Clear Creek.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">65</span></p>

  <p>The men, weary with travel, and glad to find so good a camping ground,
    lay down to sleep, leaving a sufficient guard over their captive and at
    the outposts.</p>

  <p>Their journey hither had been a perilous one to me, unused as I was to
    the rocky paths between narrow gorges and over masses of broken stone,
    which their Indian ponies climbed with readiness and ease.</p>

  <p>I was led to remark the difference between these ponies and American
    horses, who could only struggle to find their foothold over such craggy
    ground, while the ponies led the way, picking their steps up almost
    perpendicular steeps with burdens on their backs.</p>

  <p>Their travel after the rest at Clear Creek partook of the difficult
    nature of the mountain passes, and was wearisome in the extreme, and
    the duties imposed upon me made life almost too burdensome to be borne.
    I was always glad of a respite at the camping ground.</p>

  <p>On the sixth night, I lay on a rock, under the shade of some bushes,
    meditating on the possibility of escape.</p>

  <p>The way was far beyond my reckoning, and the woods where they now were
    might be infested with wild beasts; but the prospect of getting away,
    and being free from the savages, closed my eyes to the terrors of
    starvation and ravenous animals.</p>

  <p>Softly I rose and attempted to steal toward some growing timber; but
    the watchful chief did not risk his prey so carelessly, his keen eye
    was on me, and his iron hand grasped my wrist and drew me back.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">66</span></p>

  <p>Throwing me fiercely on the ground, he hissed a threat through his
    clenched teeth, which I momentarily expected him to put into execution,
    as I lay trembling at his feet.</p>

  <p>I felt from this time that my captivity was for life, and a dull
    despair took possession of me.</p>

  <p>Sleep, that balm for happier souls, brought only horrid dreams, in
    which a dreadful future pictured itself; and then the voices of my
    husband and child seemed calling me to their side, alas! in vain, for
    when I awoke it was to find myself in the grass of the savage camping
    ground, watched over by the relentless guard, and shut out from hope of
    home or civilized life.</p>

  <p>My feet were covered with a pair of good shoes, and the chiefs
    brother-in-law gave me a pair of stockings from his stores, which I
    gladly accepted, never, for a moment, suspecting that, in doing thus, I
    was outraging a custom of the people among whom I was.</p>

  <p>The chief saw the gift, and made no remark at the time, but soon after
    he shot one of his brother-in-law’s horses, which he objected to in a
    decided manner, and a quarrel ensued.</p>

  <p>Realizing that I was the cause of the disagreement, I tremblingly
    watched the contest, unable to conciliate either combatant, and
    dreading the wrath of both.</p>

  <p>The chief would brook no interference, nor would he offer any
    reparation for the wrong he had inflicted.</p>

  <p>His brother-in-law, enraged at his arrogance, drew<span class="pagenum">67</span> his bow, and aimed
    his arrow at my heart, determined to have satisfaction for the loss of
    his horse.</p>

  <p>I could only cry to God for mercy, and prepare to meet the death
    which had long hung over my head, when a young Blackfoot, whose name
    was Jumping Bear, saved me from the approaching doom by dexterously
    snatching the bow from the savage and hurling it to the earth.</p>

  <p>He was named Jumping Bear from the almost miraculous dexterity of some
    of his feats.</p>

  <p>This circumstance and the Indian mentioned were, in my judgment,
    instruments in the hand of Providence, in saving Fort Sully from the
    vengeance and slaughter of the Blackfeet, who had succeeded in gaining
    the confidence of some of the officers on the Missouri River.</p>

  <p>His activity in the attack on our train, and the energy he displayed
    in killing and pillaging on that occasion, notwithstanding his efforts
    to make me believe the contrary, forbade me to think there was any
    sympathy in his interference in my behalf.</p>

  <p>The Indian submitted to his intervention so far that he did not draw
    his bow again, and my suspense was relieved, for the time, by the gift
    of a horse from the chief to his brother-in-law, which calmed the fury
    of the wronged Indian.</p>

  <p>It happened that the animal thus given as a peace-offering was the pack
    horse that pulled so uncomfortably <span class="pagenum">68</span>against the leading rein, and thus,
    in the end, I gained, by the ordeal through which I had passed, in
    being relieved of a most unmanageable task.</p>

  <p>From the first, I was deprived of every ameliorating comfort that might
    have rendered my existence bearable.</p>

  <p>No tent was spread for me, no rug, or coverlet, offered me to lie on.
    The hard earth, sparsely spread with grass, furnished me a couch,
    and apprehension and regret deprived me of the rest my toilsome life
    demanded. They offered me no food, and at first I did not dare to ask
    for it.</p>

  <p>This was partly owing to the absence of all natural appetite, an
    intense weakness and craving constantly for drink being the only signs
    of the prolonged fast that annoyed me.</p>

  <p>The utter hopelessness of my isolation wore on me, driving me almost to
    madness, and visions of husband and child haunted my brain; sometimes
    they were full of hope and tauntingly happy; at others, I saw them
    dying or dead, but always beyond my reach, and separated by the
    impassable barrier of my probably lifelong captivity.</p>

  <p>In my weakened condition, the horrors of the stake, to which I felt
    myself borne daily nearer as they progressed on their homeward route,
    appeared like a horrid phantom.</p>

  <p>It had been threatened me since my first effort to<span class="pagenum">69</span> escape, and I was
    led to believe such a punishment was the inevitable consequence of my
    attempt.</p>

  <p>The terrible heat of the days continued, and the road they took was
    singularly barren of water. The Indians, after drinking plentifully
    before starting, carry little sticks in their mouths, which they chew
    constantly, thus creating saliva, and preventing the parching sensation
    I endured from the want of this knowledge.</p>

  <p>The seventh night they entered a singular cañon, apparently well known
    to them, as they found horses there, which evidently had been left on a
    former visit.</p>

  <p>I could not but wonder at the sagacity and patience of these Indian
    ponies, which were content to wait their master’s coming, and browse
    about on the sparse herbage and meager grass.</p>

  <p>The Indians had killed an antelope that day, and a piece of the
    raw flesh was allotted me for a meal. They had then traveled in a
    circuitous route for miles, to reach the mouth of this cañon, and
    entered it just after sundown.</p>

  <p>Its gloomy shade was a great relief after the heat of the sun, and it
    filled my sensitive mind with awe. The sun never seemed to penetrate
    its depths, and the damp air rose around me like the breath of a
    dungeon.</p>

  <p>Downward they went, as if descending into the bowels of the earth, and
    the sloping floor they trod was<span class="pagenum">70</span> covered with red sand for perhaps the
    space of half a mile.</p>

  <p>Then they struck a rocky pavement, the perpendicular walls of which
    were of earth; but as they made another turning and entered a large
    space, they seemed to change to stone with projecting arches and
    overhanging cornices.</p>

  <p>The high walls rose above the base so as to nearly meet overhead, and,
    with their innumerable juttings and irregularities, had the appearance
    of carved columns supporting a mighty ruin.</p>

  <p>Occasionally a faint ray of the fading light struggled with the gloom,
    into which they plunged deeper and deeper, and then their horses’
    cautious feet would turn the bones of antelope or deer, drawn thither
    by the lurking wolf to feed the young in their lair.</p>

  <p>I was startled with dread at the sight, fearing that they might be
    human bones, with which mine would soon be mingled.</p>

  <p>The increasing darkness had made it necessary for the Indians to carry
    torches, which they did, lighting up the grotesque grandeur of earth
    and rock through which they passed by the weird glare of their waving
    brands.</p>

  <p>Arriving at the spot they selected as a camping-ground, they made
    fires, whose fantastic gleams danced upon the rocky walls, and added
    a magic splendor to their wondrous tracery. The ghostly grandeur of
    these<span class="pagenum">71</span> unfrequented shades can not be described, but their effect is
    marvelous.</p>

  <p>They seem to shadow forth the outline of carving and sculpture, and in
    the uncertain firelight have all the effect of some old-time temple,
    whose art and glory will live forever, even when its classic stones are
    dust.</p>

  <p>Here I found water for my parched lips, which was more grateful to my
    weary senses than any natural phenomenon; and sinking on a moss-grown
    rock, near the trickling rill that sank away in the sand beyond, I
    found slumber in that strange, fantastic solitude.</p>

  <p>I was aroused by a whistling sound, and, gathering myself up, looked
    fearfully around me. Two flaming eyes seemed to pierce the darkness
    like a sword. I shuddered and held my breath, as a long, lithe serpent
    wound past me, trailing its shining length through the damp sand, and
    moving slowly out of sight among the dripping vines.</p>

  <p>After that I slept no more; and when I saw the struggling light of
    day pierce the rocky opening above, I gladly hailed the safety of the
    sunshine, even though it brought sorrow, distress, and toil.</p>

  <p>When we rose in the morning, they left the cañon by the path they
    entered, as it seemed to have no other outlet, and then pursued their
    way.</p>

    <div class="subhead">THE STORM&mdash;ARRIVAL AT THE INDIAN VILLAGE&mdash;THE OLD CHIEF’S
      WIFE&mdash;SOME KINDNESS SHOWN ME&mdash;ATTEND A FEAST.</div>
  </div>

  <p><span class="smcap">On</span> the 20th of July we had nearly reached the Indian village, when we
    camped for the night, as usual, when such a locality could be gained,
    on the bank of a stream of good water.</p>

  <p>Here was a stream of sparkling, rippling water, fresh from the melting
    snow of the mountain. It was a warm, still night. Soon the sky began
    to darken strangely, and great ragged masses of clouds hung low over
    the surrounding hills. The air grew heavy, relieved occasionally by a
    deep gust of wind, that died away, to be succeeded by an ominous calm.
    Then a low, muttering thunder jarred painfully on the ear. My shattered
    nerves recoiled at the prospect of the coming storm. From a child I had
    been timid of lightning, and now its forked gleam filled me with dismay
    in my unsheltered helplessness.</p>

  <p>The Indians, seeing the approaching tempest, prepared for it by
    collecting and fastening their horses, and covering their fire-arms and
    ammunition, and lying <span class="pagenum">73</span>flat on the earth themselves. I crouched, too,
    but could not escape the terrible glare of the lightning, and the roar
    of the awful thunder grew deafening.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_072.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">THE BUFFALO HUNT.</div>
  </div>

  <p>On came the storm with startling velocity, and the dread artillery of
    heaven boomed overhead, followed closely by blinding flashes of light;
    and the velocity of the whirlwind seemed to arise in its might, to add
    desolation to the terrible scene.</p>

  <p>When the vivid gleams lit up the air, enormous trees could be seen
    bending under the fierceness of the blast, and great white sheets of
    water burst out of the clouds, as if intent on deluging the world.
    Every element in nature united in terrific warfare, and the security
    of earth seemed denied to me while I clung to its flooded bosom, and,
    blinded by lightning and shocked by the incessant roaring of the
    thunder and the wild ravaging of the ungovernable wind, felt myself but
    a tossed atom in the great confusion, and could only cling to God’s
    remembering pity in silent prayer.</p>

  <p>Huge trees were bent to the earth and broken; others, snapped off like
    twigs, were carried through the frenzied air. Some forest monarchs were
    left bare of leaves or boughs, like desolate old age stripped of its
    honors.</p>

  <p>The rain had already swelled the little creek into a mighty stream,
    that rolled its dark, angry waters with fury, and added its sullen
    roar to the howlings of the storm. I screamed, but my voice was lost
    even to<span class="pagenum">74</span> myself in the mightier ones of the furious elements. Three
    hours&mdash;three long, never-to-be-forgotten hours&mdash;did the storm rage
    thus in fury, and in those hours I thought I lived a life-time! Then,
    to my joy, it began to abate, and soon I beheld the twinkling stars
    through rents in the driving clouds, while the flashing lightning and
    the roaring thunders gradually becoming less and less distinct to the
    eye and ear, told me the devastating storm was speeding on toward the
    east; and when, at dawn of day, the waters were assuaged, the thunder
    died away, and the lightnings were chained in their cell, the scene was
    one of indescribable desolation. The wind had gone home; daylight had
    cowed him from a raging giant into a meek prisoner, and led him moaning
    to his cavern in the eastern hills. A strangely-solemn calm seemed to
    take the place of the wild conflict; but the track of destruction was
    there, and the swollen water and felled trees, the scattered boughs and
    uprooted saplings, told the story of the havoc of the storm.</p>

  <p>It was a night of horror to pass through, and I thankfully greeted
    the returning day, that once more gave me the comfort of light, now
    almost my only solace, for my position grew more bitter, as the chief’s
    savage-like exultation in my capture and safe abduction increased as
    we neared the village where their families were, and where I feared my
    fate would be decided by bloodshed or the fearful stake.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">75</span></p>

  <p>On the 21st of July we left camp early, the day being cool and
    favorable for traveling. Our route lay over rolling prairie,
    interspersed with extensive tracts of marsh, which, however, we easily
    avoided crossing. A few miles brought us to a high, broken ridge,
    stretching nearly in a north and south direction. As we ascended the
    ridge we came in sight of a large herd of buffalo, quietly feeding
    upon the bunch, or buffalo grass, which they prefer to all other
    kinds. These animals are short-sighted, and scent the approach of an
    enemy before they can see him, and thus, in their curiosity, often
    start to meet him, until they approach near enough to ascertain to
    their satisfaction whether there be danger in a closer acquaintance.
    In this case they decided in the affirmative, and, when they had once
    fairly made us out, lost no time in increasing the distance between us,
    starting on a slow, clumsy trot, which was soon quickened to a gait
    that generally left most pursuers far in the rear.</p>

  <p>But the Indians and their horses both are trained buffalo hunters,
    and soon succeeded in surrounding a number. They ride alongside their
    victim, and, leveling their guns or arrows, send their aimed shot in
    the region of the heart, then ride off to a safe distance, to avoid
    the desperate lunge which a wounded buffalo seldom fails to make,
    and, shaking his shaggy head, crowned with horns of most formidable
    strength, stands at bay, with eyes darting, savage and defiant,<span class="pagenum">76</span> as he
    looks at his human foe. Soon the blood begins to spurt from his mouth,
    and to choke him as it comes. The hunters do not shoot again, but
    wait patiently until their victim grows weak from loss of blood, and,
    staggering, falls upon his knees, makes a desperate effort to regain
    his feet, and get at his slayer, then falling once more, rolls over on
    his side, dead.</p>

  <p>Sometimes these animals number tens of thousands, in droves. The
    Indians often, for the mere sport, make an onslaught, killing great
    numbers of them, and having a plentiful feast of “ta-tonka,” as they
    call buffalo meat. They use no economy in food. It is always a feast or
    a famine; and they seem equally able to gorge or fast. Each man selects
    the part of the animal he has killed that best suits his own taste, and
    leaves the rest to decay or be eaten by wolves, thus wasting their own
    game, and often suffering privation in consequence.</p>

  <p>They gave me a knife and motioned me to help myself to the feast. I
    did not accept, thinking then it would never be possible for me to eat
    uncooked meat.</p>

  <p>They remained here over night, starting early next morning. We were now
    nearing the village where the Indians belonged.</p>

  <p>Jumping Bear, the young Indian who had shown me so many marks of good
    will, again made his appearance, with a sad expression on his face,
    and that day would ride in silence by my side; which was an<span class="pagenum">77</span> act of
    great condescension on his part, for these men rarely thus equalize
    themselves with women, but ride in advance.</p>

  <p>They had traveled nearly three hundred miles, and, despite my fears, I
    began to rejoice in the prospect of arriving among women, even though
    they were savages; and a dawning hope that I might find pity and
    companionship with beings of my own sex, however separated their lives
    and customs might be, took possession of me.</p>

  <p>I had read of the dusky maidens of romance; I thought of all the
    characters of romance and history, wherein the nature of the red
    man is enshrined in poetic beauty. The untutored nobility of soul,
    the brave generosity, the simple dignity untrammelled by the hollow
    conventionalities of civilized life, all rose mockingly before me, and
    the heroes of my youthful imagination passed through my mind in strange
    contrast with the flesh and blood realities into whose hands I had
    fallen.</p>

  <p>The stately Logan, the fearless Philip, the bold Black Hawk, the gentle
    Pocahontas: how unlike the greedy, cunning and cruel savages who had so
    ruthlessly torn me from my friends!</p>

  <p>Truly, those pictures of the children of the forest that adorn the
    pages of the novelist are delightful conceptions of the airy fancy,
    fitted to charm the mind. They amuse and beguile the hours they invest
    with<span class="pagenum">78</span> their interest; but the true red man, as I saw him, does not
    exist between the pages of many volumes. He roams his native wastes,
    and to once encounter and study him there, so much must be sacrificed
    that I could scarcely appreciate the knowledge I was gaining at such a
    price.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding all I had seen and experienced, I remembered much that
    was gentle and faithful in the character ascribed to the Indian women.
    Perhaps I might be able to find one whose sympathy and companionship
    could be wrought upon to the extent of aiding me in some way to escape.
    I became hopeful with the thought, and almost forgot my terror of the
    threats of my captors, in my desire to see the friendly faces of Indian
    women.</p>

  <p>The country around was rich and varied. Beautiful birds appeared in the
    trees, and flowers of variety and fragrance nodded on their stems. Wild
    fruits were abundant, and I plucked roses and fruit for food, while my
    savage companions feasted on raw meat. They did not seem to care for
    fruit, and urged me to eat meat with them. I refused, because of its
    being raw. A young Indian, guessing the cause of my refusal to eat,
    procured a kettle, made a fire, cooked some, and offered it to me. I
    tried to eat of it to please them, since they had taken the trouble to
    prepare a special dish, but owing to the filthy manner in which it was
    prepared a very small portion satisfied me.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">79</span></p>

  <p>We were now nearing a river, which, from its locality, must have been
    the Tongue River, where we found refreshing drink, and rested for a
    short time. The Indians gave me to understand that when we crossed this
    stream, and a short distance beyond, we would be at their home.</p>

  <p>Here they paused to dress, so as to make a gay appearance and imposing
    entrance into the village. Except when in full dress, an Indian’s
    wearing apparel consists only of a buffalo robe, which is also part of
    a fine toilet. It is very inconveniently disposed about the person,
    without fastening, and must be held in position with the hands.</p>

  <p>Here the clothing taken from our train was brought into great demand,
    and each warrior that had been fortunate enough to possess himself of
    any article of our dress, now arrayed himself to the best advantage the
    garments and their limited ideas of civilization permitted; and, in
    some instances, when the toilet was considered complete, changes for
    less attractive articles of display were made with companions who had
    not been so fortunate as others in the division of the goods, that they
    might also share in the sport afforded by this derisive display.</p>

  <p>Their peculiar ideas of tasteful dress rendered them grotesque in
    appearance. One brawny face appeared under the shade of my hat, smiling
    with evident satisfaction at the superiority of his decorations over
    those<span class="pagenum">80</span> of his less fortunate companions; another was shaded from the
    scorching rays of the sun by a tiny parasol, and the brown hand that
    held it aloft was thinly covered by a silk glove, which was about the
    only article of clothing, except the invariable breech-cloth, that the
    warrior wore.</p>

  <p>Vests and other garments were put on with the lower part upward; and
    they all displayed remarkable fertility in the arrangement of their
    decorations. They seemed to think much of their stolen goods, some of
    which were frivolous, and others worthless.</p>

  <p>Decorating themselves by way of derision, each noble warrior endeavored
    to outdo the other in splendor, which was altogether estimated by
    color, and not by texture. Their horses were also decked in the most
    ridiculous manner.</p>

  <p>Ottawa, or Silver Horn, the war chief, was arrayed in full costume. He
    was very old, over seventy-five, partially blind, and a little below
    the medium height. He was very ferocious and savage looking, and now,
    when in costume, looked frightful. His face was red, with stripes of
    black, and around each eye a circlet of bright yellow. His long, black
    hair was divided into two braids, with a scalp-lock on top of the head.
    His ears held great brass wire rings, full six inches in diameter, and
    chains and bead necklaces were suspended from his neck; armlets and
    bracelets of brass, together with a string of bears’ claws, completed
    his<span class="pagenum">81</span> jewelry. He wore also leggings of deer skin, and a shirt of the
    same material, beautifully ornamented with beads, and fringed with
    scalp-locks, that he claimed to have taken from his enemies, both red
    and white. Over his shoulders hung a great, bright-colored quilt, that
    had been taken from our stores. He wore a crown of eagle feathers on
    his head; also a plume of feathers depending from the back of the crown.</p>

  <p>His horse, a noble-looking animal, was no less gorgeously arrayed. His
    ears were pierced, like his master’s, and his neck was encircled by a
    wreath of bears’ claws, taken from animals that the chief had slain.
    Some bells and a human scalp hung from his mane, forming together, thus
    arrayed, a museum of the trophies of the old chief’s prowess on the war
    path, and of skill in the chase.</p>

  <p>When all was arranged, the chief mounted his horse and rode on in
    triumph toward the village, highly elated over the possession of his
    white captive, whom he never looked back at or deigned to notice,
    except to chastise on account of her slowness, which was unavoidable,
    as I rode a jaded horse, and could not keep pace.</p>

  <p>The entire Indian village poured forth to meet us, amid song and wild
    dancing, in the most enthusiastic manner, flourishing flags and weapons
    of war in frenzied joy as we entered the village, which, stretched
    for miles along the banks of the stream, resembled a vast<span class="pagenum">82</span> military
    encampment, with the wigwams covered with white skins, like Sibley
    tents in shape and size, ranged without regard to order, but facing one
    point of the compass.</p>

  <p>We penetrated through the irregular settlement for over a mile,
    accompanied by the enthusiastic escort of men, women, and children.</p>

  <p>We rode in the center of a double column of Indians and directly in the
    rear of the chief, till we reached the door of his lodge, when several
    of his wives came out to meet him. He had six, but the senior one
    remained in the tent, while a younger one was absent with the Farmer
    or Grosventre Indians. Their salutation is very much in the manner of
    the Mexicans; the women crossed their arms on the chief’s breast, and
    smiled.</p>

  <p>They met me in silence, but with looks of great astonishment.</p>

  <p>I got down as directed, and followed the chief into the great lodge
    or tent, distinguished from the others by its superior ornaments. It
    was decorated with brilliantly colored porcupine quills and a terrible
    fringe of human scalp-locks, taken in battle from the Pawnees.</p>

  <p>On one side was depicted a representation of the Good Spirit, rude
    in design, and daubed with colors. On the other side was portrayed
    the figure of the spirit of evil in like manner. The Indians believe
    in these two deities and pay their homage to them. The first<span class="pagenum">83</span> they
    consider as entirely benevolent and kind; but the second is full of
    vile tricks and wicked ways.</p>

  <p>They fear him, and consider it only safe to propitiate him occasionally
    by obedience to his evil will. This may account for some of their worst
    ferocities, and explain that horrible brutality of nature which they so
    often exhibit.</p>

  <p>The senior wife, who had remained in the lodge, met her husband with
    the same salutation as the others had done.</p>

  <p>I was shown a seat opposite the entrance on a buffalo skin. The chief’s
    spoil was brought in for division by his elderly spouse.</p>

  <p>As it was spread out before them, the women gathered admiringly round
    it, and proved their peculiarities of taste; and love of finery had a
    counterpart in these forest belles, as well defined as if they had been
    city ladies. Eagerly they watched every new article displayed, grunting
    their approval, until their senior companion seized a piece of cloth,
    declaring that she meant to retain it all for herself.</p>

  <p>This occasioned dissatisfaction, which soon ripened to rebellion among
    them, and they contended for a just distribution of the goods. The
    elder matron, following her illustrious husband’s plan in quelling such
    outbreaks, caught her knife from her belt, sprang in among them, vowing
    that she was the oldest and had the right to govern, and threatening
    to kill every one if there<span class="pagenum">84</span> was the least objection offered to her
    decrees. I had so hoped to find sympathy and pity among these artless
    women of the forest, but instead, cowed and trembling, I sat, scarcely
    daring to breathe.</p>

  <p>The chief noticed my fear and shrinking posture, and smiled. Then he
    rose, and made a speech, which had its effect. The women became quiet.
    Presently an invitation arrived for the chief to go to a feast, and he
    rose to comply.</p>

  <p>I followed his departing figure with regretful glances, for, terrible
    as he and his men had been, the women seemed still more formidable, and
    I feared to be left alone with them, especially with the hot temper and
    ready knife of the elder squaw.</p>

  <p>Great crowds of curious Indians came flocking in to stare at me. The
    women brought their children. Some of them, whose fair complexion
    astonished me, I afterward learned were the offspring of fort marriages.</p>

  <p>One fair little boy, who, with his mother, had just returned from Fort
    Laramie, came close to me. Finding the squaw could speak a few words
    in English, I addressed her, and was told, in reply to my questions,
    that she had been the wife of a captain there, but that his white
    wife arriving from the East, his Indian wife was told to return to
    her people; she did so, taking her child with her. The little boy was
    dressed completely in military clothes, even to the stripe on his
    pantaloons,<span class="pagenum">85</span> and was a very bright, attractive child of about four
    years.</p>

  <p>It was a very sad thought for me to realize that a parent could
    part with such a child, committing it forever to live in barbarous
    ignorance, and rove the woods among savages with the impress of his own
    superior race, so strongly mingled with his Indian origin. I saw many
    other fair-faced little children, and heard the sad story from their
    mothers, and was deeply pained to see their pale, pinched features,
    as they cried for food when there was none to be had; and they are
    sometimes cruelly treated by the full-blooded and larger children on
    account of their unfortunate birth.</p>

  <p>Now that the question of property was decided between the women of the
    chief’s family, they seemed kindly disposed toward me, and one of them
    brought me a dish of meat; many others followed her example, even from
    the neighboring lodges, and really seemed to pity me, and showed great
    evidences of compassion, and tried to express their sympathy in signs,
    because I had been torn from my own people, and compelled to come such
    a long fatiguing journey, and examined me all over and over again,
    and all about my dress, hands, and feet particularly. Then, to their
    great surprise, they discovered my bruised and almost broken limbs that
    occurred when first taken, also from the fall of the horse the first
    night of my captivity, and proceeded at once to dress my wounds.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">86</span></p>

  <p>I was just beginning to rejoice in the dawning kindness that seemed
    to soften their swarthy faces, when a messenger from the war chief
    arrived, accompanied by a small party of young warriors sent to conduct
    me to the chief’s presence. I did not at first comprehend the summons,
    and, as every fresh announcement only awakened new fears, I dreaded to
    comply, yet dared not refuse. Seeing my hesitation, the senior wife
    allowed a little daughter of the chief’s, whose name was Yellow Bird,
    to accompany me, and I was then conducted to several feasts, at each
    of which I was received with kindness, and promised good will and
    protection. It was here that the chief himself first condescended to
    speak kindly to me, and this and the companionship of the child Yellow
    Bird, who seemed to approach me with a trusting grace and freedom
    unlike the scared shyness of Indian children generally, inspired hope.</p>

  <p>The chief here told me that henceforth I could call Yellow Bird my own,
    to take the place of my little girl that had been killed. I did not
    at once comprehend all of his meaning, still it gave me some hope of
    security.</p>

  <p>When at nightfall we returned to the lodge, which, they told me, I must
    henceforth regard as home, I found the elder women busily pounding a
    post into the ground, and my fears were at once aroused, being always
    ready to take alarm, and suggested to me that it betokened some evil.
    On the contrary, it was simply<span class="pagenum">87</span> some household arrangement of her own,
    for presently, putting on a camp kettle, she built a fire, and caused
    water to boil, and drew a tea, of which she gave me a portion, assuring
    me that it would cure the tired and weary feeling and secure me a good
    rest.</p>

  <p>This proved true. Soon a deep drowsiness began to steal over the weary
    captive. My bed of furs was shown me. Yellow Bird was told to share my
    couch with me, and from this time on she was my constant attendant. I
    laid down, and the wife of the chief tenderly removed my moccasins,
    and I slept sweetly&mdash;the first true sleep I had enjoyed in many weary
    nights.</p>

  <p>Before my eyes closed, in slumber, my heart rose in gratitude
    unspeakable to God for his great and immeasurable mercy.</p>

  <p>I readily adapted myself to my new position. The chief’s three sisters
    shared the lodge with us.</p>

  <p>The following day commenced my labors, and the chief’s wife seemed to
    feel a protecting interest in me.</p>

  <p>The day of the 25th of July was observed by continual feasting in honor
    of the safe return of the braves.</p>

  <p>There was a large tent made by putting several together, where all
    the chiefs, medicine-men, and great warriors met for consultation and
    feasting. I was invited to attend, and was given an elevated seat,
    while the rest of the company all sat upon the ground, and<span class="pagenum">88</span> mostly
    cross-legged, preparatory to the feast being dealt out.</p>

  <p>In the center of the circle was erected a flag-staff, with many scalps,
    trophies, and ornaments fastened to it. Near the foot of the flag-staff
    were placed, in a row on the ground, several large kettles, in which
    was prepared the feast. Near the kettles on the ground, also, were a
    number of wooden bowls, in which the meat was to be served out. And in
    front, two or three women, who were there placed as waiters, to light
    the pipes for smoking, and also to deal out the food.</p>

  <p>In these positions things stood, and all sat with thousands climbing
    and crowding around for a peep at me, as I appeared at the grand
    feast and council, when at length the chief arose, in a very handsome
    costume, and addressed the audience, and in his speech often pointed to
    me. I could understand but little of his meaning.</p>

  <p>Several others also made speeches, that all sounded the same to me. I
    sat trembling with fear at these strange proceedings, fearing they were
    deliberating upon a plan of putting me to some cruel death to finish
    their amusement. It is impossible to describe my feelings on that day,
    as I sat in the midst of those wild, savage people. Soon a handsome
    pipe was lit and brought to the chief to smoke. He took it, and after
    presenting the stem to the north, the south, the east, and the west,
    and then to the sun that was over his head, uttered a<span class="pagenum">89</span> few words, drew
    a few whiffs, then passed it around through the whole group, who all
    smoked. This smoking was conducted with the strictest adherence to
    exact and established form, and the feast throughout was conducted in
    the most positive silence.</p>

  <p>The lids were raised from the kettles, which were all filled with dog’s
    meat alone, it being well cooked and made into a sort of stew. Each
    guest had a large wooden bowl placed before him, with a quantity of
    dog’s flesh floating in a profusion of soup or rich gravy, with a large
    spoon resting in the dish, made of buffalo horn.</p>

  <p>In this most difficult and painful dilemma I sat, witnessing the
    solemnity; my dish was given me, and the absolute necessity of eating
    it was painful to contemplate. I tasted it a few times after much
    urging, and then resigned my dish, which was taken and passed around
    with others to every part of the group, who all ate heartily. In this
    way the feast ended, and all retired silently and gradually, until the
    ground was left to the waiters, who seemed to have charge of it during
    the whole occasion.</p>

  <p>The women signified to me that I should feel highly honored by being
    called to feast with chiefs and great warriors; and seeing the spirit
    in which it was given, I could not but treat it respectfully, and
    receive it as a very high and marked compliment.</p>

  <p>Since I witnessed it on this occasion, I have been<span class="pagenum">90</span> honored with
    numerous entertainments of the kind, and all conducted in the same
    solemn and impressive manner.</p>

  <p>As far as I could see and understand, I feel authorized to pronounce
    the dog-feast a truly religious ceremony, wherein the superstitious
    Indian sees fit to sacrifice his faithful companion to bear testimony
    to the sacredness of his vows of friendship for the Great Spirit. He
    always offers up a portion of the meat to his deity, then puts it on
    the ground to remind him of the sacrifice and solemnity of the offering.</p>

  <p>The dog, among all Indian tribes, is more esteemed and more valued than
    among any part of the civilized world. The Indian has more time to
    devote to his company, and his untutored mind more nearly assimilates
    to the nature of his faithful servant.</p>

  <p>The flesh of these dogs, though apparently relished by the Indians, is
    undoubtedly inferior to venison and buffalo meat, of which feasts are
    constantly made, where friends are invited, as they are in civilized
    society, to a pleasant and convivial party; from which fact alone,
    it would seem clear that they have some extraordinary motive, at all
    events, for feasting on the flesh of that useful and faithful animal,
    even when as in the instance I have been describing.</p>

  <p>Their village was well supplied with fresh and dried meat of the
    buffalo and deer. The dog-feast is given, I believe, by all tribes
    of America, and by them all,<span class="pagenum">91</span> I think, this faithful animal, as well
    as the horse, is sacrificed, in several different ways, to appease
    offended spirits or deities, whom it is considered necessary that they
    should conciliate in this way, and when done, is invariably done by
    giving the best in the herd or the kennel.</p>

  <p>That night was spent in dancing. Wild and furious all seemed to me. I
    was led into the center of the circle, and assigned the painful duty of
    holding above my head human scalps fastened to a little pole. The dance
    was kept up until near morning, when all repaired to their respective
    lodges. The three kind sisters of the chief were there to convey me to
    mine.</p>

  </div>

  <p><span class="smcap">The</span> next morning the whole village was in motion. The warriors were
    going to battle against a white enemy, they said, and old men, women,
    and children were sent out in another direction to a place of safety,
    as designated by the chief. Every thing was soon moving. With the
    rapidity of custom the tent-poles were lowered and the tents rolled
    up. The cooking utensils were put together, and laid on cross-beams
    connecting the lower ends of the poles as they trail the ground from
    the horses’ sides, to which they are attached. Dogs, too, are made
    useful in this exodus, and started off, with smaller burdens dragging
    after them, in the same manner that horses are packed.</p>

  <p>The whole village was in commotion, children screaming or laughing;
    dogs barking or growling under their heavy burdens; squaws running
    hither <span class="pagenum">93</span>and thither, pulling down tipi-poles, packing up every thing,
    and leading horses and dogs with huge burdens.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_092.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">Indian Family on the Move.</div>
  </div>

  <p>The small children are placed in sacks of buffalo skin and hung upon
    saddles or their mothers’ backs. The wrapped up lodges, which are
    secured by thongs, are fastened to the poles on the horses’ backs,
    together with sundry other articles of domestic use, and upon these
    are seated women and children. To guide the horse a woman goes before,
    holding the bridle, carrying on her back a load nearly as large as the
    horse carries. Women and children are sometimes mounted upon horses,
    holding in their arms every variety of plunder, sometimes little dogs
    and other forlorn and hungry looking pets. In this unsightly manner,
    sometimes two or three thousand families are transported many miles
    at the same migration, and, all being in motion at the same time, the
    cavalcade extends for a great distance.</p>

  <p>The men and boys are not so unsightly in their appearance, being
    mounted upon good horses and the best Indian ponies, riding in groups,
    leaving the women and children to trudge along with the burdened horses
    and dogs.</p>

  <p>The number and utility of these faithful dogs is sometimes astonishing,
    as they count hundreds, each bearing a portion of the general household
    goods. Two poles, about ten or twelve feet long, are attached<span class="pagenum">94</span> to the
    shoulders of a dog, leaving one end of each dragging upon the ground.
    On these poles a small burden is carried, and with it the faithful
    canine jogs along, looking neither to the right nor to the left, but
    apparently intent upon reaching the end of his journey. These faithful
    creatures are under the charge of women and children, and their pace
    is occasionally encouraged with admonitions in the form of vigorous
    and zealous use of whips applied to their limbs and sides. It was
    quite painful to me to see these poor animals, thus taken from their
    natural avocation, and forced to a slavish life of labor, and compelled
    to travel along with their burdens; yet, when this change has been
    made, they become worthless as hunters, or watchers, and even for the
    purpose of barking, being reduced, instead, to beasts of burden. It was
    not uncommon to see a great wolfish-looking dog moodily jogging along
    with a lot of cooking utensils on one side, and on the other a crying
    papoose for a balance, while his sulking companion toils on, supporting
    upon his back a quarter of antelope or elk, and is followed by an old
    woman, or some children, who keep at bay all refractory dogs who run
    loose, occasionally showing their superiority by snapping and snarling
    at their more unfortunate companions.</p>

  <p>This train was immensely large, nearly the whole Sioux nation having
    concentrated there for the purpose of war. The chief’s sisters brought
    me a horse<span class="pagenum">95</span> saddled, told me to mount, and accompany the already
    moving column, that seemed to be spreading far over the hills to the
    northward. We toiled on all day. Late in the afternoon we arrived
    at the ground of encampment, and rested for further orders from the
    warriors, who had gone to battle and would join us there.</p>

  <p>I had no means of informing myself at that time with whom the war was
    raging, but afterward learned that General Sully’s army was pursuing
    the Sioux, and that the engagement was with his men.</p>

  <p>In three days the Indians returned to camp, and entered on a course
    of feasting and rejoicing, that caused me to believe that they had
    suffered very little loss in the affray.</p>

  <p>They passed their day of rest in this sort of entertainment; and here I
    first saw the scalp dance, which ceremonial did not increase my respect
    or confidence in the tender mercies of my captors.</p>

  <p>This performance is only gone through at night and by the light of
    torches, consequently its terrible characteristics are heightened by
    the fantastic gleams of the lighted brands.</p>

  <p>The women, too, took part in the dance, and I was forced to mingle
    in the fearful festivity, painted and dressed for the occasion, and
    holding a staff from the top of which hung several scalps.</p>

  <p>The braves came vauntingly forth, with the most extravagant boasts
    of their wonderful prowess and<span class="pagenum">96</span> courage in war, at the same time
    brandishing weapons in their hands with the most fearful contortions
    and threatenings.</p>

  <p>A number of young women came with them, carrying the trophies of their
    friends, which they hold aloft, while the warriors jump around in a
    circle, brandishing their weapons, and whooping and yelling the fearful
    war-cry in a most frightful manner, all jumping upon both feet at the
    same time, with simultaneous stamping and motions with their weapons,
    keeping exact time. Their gestures impress one as if they were actually
    cutting and carving each other to pieces as they utter their fearful,
    sharp yell. They become furious as they grow more excited, until their
    faces are distorted to the utmost; their glaring eyes protrude with a
    fiendish, indescribable appearance, while they grind their teeth, and
    try to imitate the hissing, gurgling sound of death in battle. Furious
    and faster grows the stamping, until the sight is more like a picture
    of fiends in a carnival of battle than any thing else to which the
    war-dance can be compared.</p>

  <p>No description can fully convey the terrible sight in all its fearful
    barbarity, as the bloody trophies of their victory are brandished aloft
    in the light of the flickering blaze, and their distorted forms were
    half concealed by darkness. The object for which the scalp is taken
    is exultation and proof of valor and success. My pen is powerless to
    portray my feelings during this terrible scene.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">97</span></p>

  <p>This country seemed scarred by countless trails, where the Indian
    ponies have dragged lodge-poles, in their change of habitations or
    hunting. The antipathy of the Indian to its occupation or invasion by
    the white man is very intense and bitter. The felling of timber, or
    killing of buffalo, or traveling of a train, or any signs of permanent
    possession by the white man excites deadly hostility. It is their last
    hope; if they yield and give up this, they will have to die or ever
    after be governed by the white man’s laws; consequently they lose no
    opportunity to kill or steal from and harass the whites when they can
    do so.</p>

  <p>The game still clings to its favorite haunts, and the Indian must press
    upon the steps of the white man or lose all hope of independence. Herds
    of elk proudly stand with erect antlers, as if charmed by music, or as
    if curious to understand this strange inroad upon their long-secluded
    parks of pleasure; the mountain sheep look down from belting crags that
    skirt the perpendicular northern face of the mountains, and yield no
    rival of their charms or excellence for food. The black and white-tail
    deer and antelope are ever present, while the hare and the rabbit, the
    sage hen, and the prairie-chicken are nearly trodden down before they
    yield to the intrusion of the stranger.</p>

  <p>Brants, wild geese, and ducks multiply and people the waters of
    beautiful lakes, and are found in many of the streams. The grizzly and
    cinnamon bears are<span class="pagenum">98</span> often killed and give up their rich material for
    the hunter’s profit; and the buffalo, in numberless herds, with tens of
    thousands in a herd, sweep back and forth, filling the valley as far as
    the eye can reach, and adding their value to the red man both for food,
    habitation, fuel, and clothing. The Big Horn River, and mountains and
    streams beyond, are plentifully supplied with various kinds of fish.
    The country seems to be filled with wolves, which pierce the night air
    with their howls, but, like the beavers whose dams incumber all the
    smaller streams, and the otter, are forced to yield their nice coats
    for the Indian as well as white man’s luxury.</p>

  <p>The Indians felt that the proximity of the troops and their inroads
    through their best hunting-grounds would prove disastrous to them and
    their future hopes of prosperity, and soon again they were making
    preparations for battle; and again, on the 8th of August, the warriors
    set forth on the war-path, and this time the action seemed to draw
    ominously near our encampment.</p>

  <p>An Indian boy died the night before, and was buried rather hastily
    in the morning. The body was wrapped in some window curtains that
    once draped my windows at Geneva. There was also a red blanket and
    many beads and trinkets deposited on an elevated platform, with the
    moldering remains, and the bereaved mother and relatives left the
    lonely spot with loud lamentations. <span class="pagenum">99</span>There seemed to be great commotion
    and great anxiety in the movements of the Indians, and presently I
    could hear the sound of battle; and the echoes, that came back to me
    from the reports of the guns in the distant hills, warned me of the
    near approach of my own people, and my heart became a prey to wildly
    conflicting emotions, as they hurried on in great desperation, and even
    forbid me turning my head and looking in the direction of the battle.
    Once I broke the rule and was severely punished for it. They kept their
    eyes upon me, and were very cross and unkind.</p>

  <p>Panting for rescue, yet fearing for its accomplishment, I passed the
    day. The smoke of action now rose over the hills beyond. The Indians
    now realized their danger, and hurried on in great consternation.</p>

  <p>General Sully’s soldiers appeared in close proximity, and I could
    see them charging on the Indians, who, according to their habits
    of warfare, skulked behind trees, sending their bullets and arrows
    vigorously forward into the enemy’s ranks. I was kept in advance of the
    moving column of women and children, who were hurrying on, crying and
    famishing for water, trying to keep out of the line of firing.</p>

  <p>It was late at night before we stopped our pace, when at length we
    reached the lofty banks of a noble river, but it was some time before
    they could find a break in the rocky shores which enabled us to reach<span class="pagenum">100</span>
    the water and enjoy the delicious draught, in which luxury the panting
    horses gladly participated.</p>

  <p>We had traveled far and fast all day long, without cessation, through
    clouds of smoke and dust, parched by a scorching sun. My face was
    blistered from the burning rays, as I had been compelled to go with my
    head uncovered, after the fashion of all Indian women. Had not had a
    drop of water during the whole day.</p>

  <p>Reluctant to leave the long-desired acquisition, they all lay down
    under the tall willows, close to the stream, and slept the sleep of the
    weary. The horses lingered near, nipping the tender blades of grass
    that sparsely bordered the stream.</p>

  <p>It was not until next morning that I thought of how they should cross
    the river, which I suppose to have been the Missouri. It was not very
    wide, but confined between steep banks; it seemed to be deep and quite
    rapid; they did not risk swimming at that place, to my joy, but went
    further down and all plunged in and swam across, leading my horse.
    I was very much frightened, and cried to Heaven for mercy. On that
    morning we entered a gorge, a perfect mass of huge fragments which had
    fallen from the mountains above; they led my horse and followed each
    other closely, and with as much speed as possible, as we were still
    pursued by the troops. During the day some two or three warriors were
    brought in wounded. I was<span class="pagenum">101</span> called to see them, and assist in dressing
    their wounds. This being my first experience of the kind, I was at some
    loss to know what was best to do; but, seeing in it a good opportunity
    to raise in their estimation, I endeavored to impress them with an air
    of my superior knowledge of surgery, and as nurse, or medicine woman.
    I felt now, from their motions and meaning glances, that my life was
    not safe, since we were so closely pursued over this terrible barren
    country.</p>

  <p>My feelings, all this time, can not be described, when I could hear
    the sound of the big guns, as the Indians term cannon. I felt that
    the soldiers had surely come for me and would overtake us, and my
    heart bounded with joy at the very thought of deliverance, but sunk
    proportionately when they came to me, bearing their trophies, reeking
    scalps, soldiers’ uniforms, covered with blood, which told its sad
    story to my aching heart. One day I might be cheered by strong hope
    of approaching relief, then again would have such assurance of my
    enemies’ success as would sink me correspondingly low in despair. For
    some reason deception seemed to be their peculiar delight; whether
    they did it to gratify an insatiable thirst for revenge in themselves,
    or to keep me more reconciled, more willing and patient to abide, was
    something I could not determine.</p>

  <p>The feelings occasioned by my disappointment in their success can be
    better imagined than described, but imagination, even in her most
    extravagant flights,<span class="pagenum">102</span> can but poorly picture the horrors that met my
    view during these running flights.</p>

  <p>My constant experience was hope deferred that maketh the heart sick. It
    was most tantalizing and painful to my spirit to be so near our forces
    and the flag of liberty, and yet a prisoner and helpless.</p>

  <p>On, and still on, we were forced to fly to a place known among them as
    the Bad Lands, a section of country so wildly desolate and barren as to
    induce the belief that its present appearance is the effect of volcanic
    action.</p>

  <p>Great boulders of blasted rock are piled scattering round, and hard,
    dry sand interspersed among the crevices.</p>

  <p>Every thing has a ruined look, as if vegetation and life had formerly
    existed there, but had been suddenly interrupted by some violent
    commotion of nature. A terrible blight, like the fulfilling of an
    ancient curse, darkens the surface of the gloomy landscape, and the
    desolate, ruinous scene might well represent the entrance to the
    infernal shades described by classic writers.</p>

  <p>A choking wind, with sand, blows continually, and fills the air with
    dry and blinding dust.</p>

  <p>The water is sluggish and dark, and apparently life-destroying in its
    action, since all that lies around its moistened limits has assumed the
    form of petrifaction. Rocks though they now seemed, they had formerly
    held life, both animal and vegetable, and their change will<span class="pagenum">103</span> furnish a
    subject of interesting speculation to enterprising men of science, who
    penetrate those mournful shades to discover toads, snakes, birds, and a
    variety of insects, together with plants, trees, and many curiosities,
    all petrified and having the appearance of stone. I was startled by the
    strange and wonderful sights.</p>

  <p>The terrible scarcity of water and grass urged us forward, and General
    Sully’s army in the rear gave us no rest. The following day or two we
    were driven so far northward, and became so imminently imperiled by
    the pursuing forces, that they were obliged to leave all their earthly
    effects behind them, and swim the Yellow Stone River for life. By this
    time the ponies were completely famished for want of food and water, so
    jaded that it was with great difficulty and hard blows that we could
    urge them on at all.</p>

  <p>When Indians are pursued closely, they evince a desperate and reckless
    desire to save themselves, without regard to property or provisions.</p>

  <p>They throw away every thing that will impede flight, and all natural
    instinct seems lost in fear. We had left, in our compulsory haste,
    immense quantities of plunder, even lodges standing, which proved
    immediate help, but in the end a terrible loss.</p>

  <p>General Sully with his whole troop stopped to destroy the property,
    thus giving us an opportunity to escape, which saved us from falling
    into his hands, as otherwise we inevitably would have done.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">104</span></p>

  <p>One day was consumed in collecting and burning the Indian lodges,
    blankets, provisions, etc., and that day was used advantageously in
    getting beyond his reach. They travel constantly in time of war,
    ranging over vast tracts of country, and prosecuting their battles, or
    skirmishes, with a quiet determination unknown to the whites.</p>

  <p>A few days’ pursuit after Indians is generally enough to wear and tire
    out the ardor of the white man, as it is almost impossible to pursue
    them through their own country with wagons and supplies for the army,
    and it is very difficult for American horses to traverse the barren,
    rugged mountain passes, the Indians having every advantage in their
    own country, and using their own mode of warfare. The weary soldiers
    return disheartened by often losing dear comrades, and leaving them in
    a lonely grave on the plain, dissatisfied with only scattering their
    red foes.</p>

  <p>But the weary savages rest during these intervals, often sending the
    friendly Indians, as they are called and believed to be, who are
    received in that character in the forts, and change it for a hostile
    one, as soon as they reach the hills, to get supplies of ammunition and
    food with which they refresh themselves and prosecute the war.</p>

  <p>After the attack of General Sully was over an Indian came to me with
    a letter to read, which he had taken from a soldier who was killed by
    him, and the<span class="pagenum">105</span> letter had been found in his pocket. The letter stated
    that the topographical engineer was killed, and that General Sully’s
    men had caught the red devils and cut their heads off, and stuck them
    up on poles. The soldier had written a friendly and kind letter to his
    people, but, ere it was mailed, he was numbered with the dead.</p>

      STAKE&mdash;SAVED BY A SPEECH FROM OTTAWA&mdash;STARVING CONDITION OF THE INDIANS.</div>
  </div>

  <p><span class="smcap">As</span> soon as we were safe, and General Sully pursued us no longer, the
    warriors returned home, and a scene of terrible mourning over the
    killed ensued among the women. Their cries are terribly wild and
    distressing, on such occasions; and the near relations of the deceased
    indulge in frantic expressions of grief that can not be described.
    Sometimes the practice of cutting the flesh is carried to a horrible
    and barbarous extent. They inflict gashes on their bodies and limbs an
    inch in length. Some cut off their hair, blacken their faces, and march
    through the village in procession, torturing their bodies to add vigor
    to their lamentations.</p>

  <p>Hunger followed on the track of grief; all their food was gone, and
    there was no game in that portion of the country.</p>

  <p>In our flight they scattered every thing, and the country through which
    we passed for the following two weeks did not yield enough to arrest
    starvation. The<span class="pagenum">107</span> Indians were terribly enraged, and threatened me with
    death almost hourly, and in every form.</p>

  <p>I had so hoped for liberty when my friends were near; but alas! all my
    fond hopes were blasted. The Indians told me that the army was going in
    another direction.</p>

  <p>They seemed to have sustained a greater loss than I had been made aware
    of, which made them feel very revengeful toward me.</p>

  <p>The next morning I could see that something unusual was about to
    happen. Notwithstanding the early hour, the sun scarcely appearing
    above the horizon, the principal chiefs and warriors were assembled in
    council, where, judging from the grave and reflective expression of
    their countenances, they were about to discuss some serious question.</p>

  <p>I had reason for apprehension, from their unfriendly manner toward me,
    and feared for the penalty I might soon have to pay.</p>

  <p>Soon they sent an Indian to me, who asked me if I was ready to die&mdash;to
    be burned at the stake. I told him whenever Wakon-Tonka (the Great
    Spirit) was ready, he would call for me, and then I would be ready and
    willing to go. He said that he had been sent from the council to warn
    me, that it had become necessary to put me to death, on account of my
    white brothers killing so many of their young men recently. He repeated
    that they were not cruel for the pleasure<span class="pagenum">108</span> of being so; necessity
    is their first law, and he and the wise chiefs, faithful to their
    hatred for the white race, were in haste to satisfy their thirst for
    vengeance; and, further, that the interest of their nation required it.</p>

  <p>As soon as the chiefs were assembled around the council fire, the
    pipe-carrier entered the circle, holding in his hand the pipe ready
    lighted. Bowing to the four cardinal points, he uttered a short prayer,
    or invocation, and then presented the pipe to the old chief, Ottawa,
    but retained the bowl in his hand. When all the chiefs and men had
    smoked, one after the other, the pipe-bearer emptied the ashes into the
    fire, saying, “Chiefs of the great Dakota nation, Wakon-Tonka give you
    wisdom, so that whatever be your determination, it may be conformable
    to justice.” Then, after bowing respectfully, he retired.</p>

  <p>A moment of silence followed, in which every one seemed to be
    meditating seriously upon the words that had just been spoken. At
    length one of the most aged of the chiefs, whose body was furrowed with
    the scars of innumerable wounds, and who enjoyed among his people a
    reputation for great wisdom, arose.</p>

  <p>Said he, “The pale faces, our eternal persecutors, pursue and harass
    us without intermission, forcing us to abandon to them, one by one,
    our best hunting grounds, and we are compelled to seek a refuge in the
    depths of these Bad Lands, like timid deer. Many of them even dare to
    come into prairies which belong to us,<span class="pagenum">109</span> to trap beaver, and hunt elk
    and buffalo, which are our property. These faithless creatures, the
    outcasts of their own people, rob and kill us when they can. Is it just
    that we should suffer these wrongs without complaining? Shall we allow
    ourselves to be slaughtered like timid Assinneboines, without seeking
    to avenge ourselves? Does not the law of the Dakotas say, Justice to
    our own nation, and death to all pale faces? Let my brothers say if
    that is just,” pointing to the stake that was being prepared for me.</p>

  <p>“Vengeance is allowable,” sententiously remarked Mahpeah (The Sky).</p>

  <p>Another old chief, Ottawa, arose and said, “It is the undoubted right
    of the weak and oppressed; and yet it ought to be proportioned to the
    injury received. Then why should we put this young, innocent woman to
    death? Has she not always been kind to us, smiled upon us, and sang for
    us? Do not all our children love her as a tender sister? Why, then,
    should we put her to so cruel a death for the crimes of others, if they
    are of her nation? Why should we punish the innocent for the guilty?”</p>

  <p>I looked to Heaven for mercy and protection, offering up those earnest
    prayers that are never offered in vain; and oh! how thankful I was when
    I knew their decision was to spare my life. Though terrible were my
    surroundings, life always became sweet to me, when I felt that I was
    about to part with it.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">110</span></p>

  <p>A terrible time ensued, and many dogs, and horses, even, died of
    starvation. Their bodies were eaten immediately; and the slow but
    constant march was daily kept up, in hope of game and better facilities
    for fish and fruit.</p>

  <p>Many days in succession I tasted no food, save what I could gather on
    my way; a few rose leaves and blossoms was all I could find, except
    the grass I would gather and chew, for nourishment. Fear, fatigue, and
    long-continued abstinence were wearing heavily on my already shattered
    frame. Women and children were crying for food; it was a painful sight
    to witness their sufferings, with no means of alleviating them, and no
    hope of relief save by traveling and hunting. We had no shelter save
    the canopy of heaven, and no alternative but to travel on, and at night
    lie down on the cold, damp ground, for a resting place.</p>

  <p>If I could but present to my readers a truthful picture of that Indian
    home at that time, with all its sorrowful accompaniments! They are
    certainly engraved upon faithful memory, to last forever; but no touch
    of pen could give any semblance of the realities to another.</p>

  <p>What exhibitions of their pride and passion I have seen; what ideas of
    their intelligence and humanity I have been compelled to form; what
    manifestations of their power and ability to govern had been thrust
    upon me. The treatment received was not such as<span class="pagenum">111</span> to enhance in any wise
    a woman’s admiration for the so-called noble red man, but rather to
    make one pray to be delivered from their power.</p>

  <p>Compelled to travel many days in succession, and to experience the
    gnawings of hunger without mitigation, every day had its share of toil
    and fear. Yet while my temporal wants were thus poorly supplied, I was
    not wholly denied spiritual food. It was a blessed consolation that no
    earthly foe could interrupt my communion with the heavenly world. In my
    midnight, wakeful hours, I was visited with many bright visions.</p>

      FLETCHER&mdash;FIVE CHILDREN SLAUGHTERED&mdash;FATE OF THEIR MOTHER.</div>
  </div>

  <p><span class="smcap">It</span> was about this time that I had the sorrowful satisfaction of meeting
    with a victim of Indian cruelty, whose fate was even sadder than mine.</p>

  <p>It was a part of my labor to carry water from the stream at which we
    camped, and, awakened for that purpose, I arose and hurried out one
    morning before the day had yet dawned clearly, leaving the Indians
    still in their blankets, and the village very quiet.</p>

  <p>In the woods beyond I heard the retiring howl of the wolf, the shrill
    shriek of the bird of prey, as it was sweeping down on the unburied
    carcass of some poor, murdered traveler, and the desolation of my life
    and its surroundings filled my heart with dread and gloom.</p>

  <p>I was so reduced in strength and spirit, that nothing but the dread of
    the scalping-knife urged my feet from task to task; and now, returning
    toward the tipi, with my heavy bucket, I was startled to behold a
    fair-faced, <span class="pagenum">113</span>beautiful young girl sitting there, dejected and worn,
    like myself, but bearing the marks of loveliness and refinement,
    despite her neglected covering.</p>

  <p>Almost doubting my reason, for I had become unsettled in my
    self-reliance, and even sanity, I feared to address her, but stood
    spell-bound, gazing in her sad brown eyes and drooping, pallid face.</p>

  <p>The chief stood near the entrance of the tipi, enjoying the cool
    morning air, and watching the interview with amusement. He offered me a
    book, which chanced to be one of the Willson’s readers, stolen from our
    wagons, and bade me show it to the stranger.</p>

  <p>I approached the girl, who instantly held out her hand, and said: “What
    book is that?”</p>

  <p>The sound of my own language, spoken by one of my own people, was too
    much for me, and I sank to the ground by the side of the stranger, and,
    endeavoring to clasp her in my arms, became insensible.</p>

  <p>A kindly squaw, who was in sight, must have been touched by our
    helpless sorrow; for, when recovering, she was sprinkling my face with
    water from the bucket, and regarding me with looks of interest.</p>

  <p>Of course, we realized that this chance interview would be short,
    and, perhaps, the last that we would be able to enjoy, and, while
    my companion covered her face and wept, I told my name and the main
    incidents of my capture; and I dreaded to recall the possible fate of
    my Mary, lest I should rouse the terrible feelings <span class="pagenum">114</span>I was trying to
    keep in subjection as my only hope of preserving reason.</p>

  <p>The young girl responded to my confidence by giving her own story,
    which she related to me as follows:</p>

  <p>“My name is Mary Boyeau; these people call me Madee. I have been among
    them since the massacre in Minnesota, and am now in my sixteenth year.
    My parents were of French descent, but we lived in the State of New
    York, until my father, in pursuance of his peculiar passion for the
    life of a naturalist and a man of science, sold our eastern home, and
    came to live on the shores of Spirit Lake, Minnesota.</p>

  <p>“The Indians had watched about our place, and regarded what they had
    seen of my father’s chemical apparatus with awe and fear. Perhaps
    they suspected him of working evil charms in his laboratory, or held
    his magnets, microscopes, and curiously-shaped tubes in superstitious
    aversion.</p>

  <p>“I can not tell; I only know that we were among the first victims of
    the massacre, and that all my family were murdered except myself, and,
    I fear, one younger sister.”</p>

  <p>“You fear!” said I. “Do you not hope that she escaped?”</p>

  <p>The poor girl shook her head. “From a life like mine death is an
    escape,” she said, bitterly.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">115</span></p>

  <p>“Oh! it is fearful! and a sin to rush unbidden into God’s presence, but
    I can not live through another frightful winter.</p>

  <p>“No, I must and will die if no relief comes to me. For a year these
    people regarded me as a child, and then a young man of their tribe gave
    a horse for me, and carried me to his tipi as his wife.”</p>

  <p>“Do you love your husband?” I asked.</p>

  <p>A look, bitter and revengeful, gleamed from her eyes.</p>

  <p>“Love a savage, who bought me to be a drudge and slave!” she repeated.
    “No! I hate him as I hate all that belong to this fearful bondage. He
    has another wife and a child. Thank God!” she added, with a shudder,
    “that I am not a mother!”</p>

  <p>Misery and the consciousness of her own degraded life seemed to have
    made this poor young creature desperate; and, looking at her toil-worn
    hands and scarred arms, I saw the signs of abuse and cruelty; her feet,
    too, were bare, and fearfully bruised and travel-marked.</p>

  <p>“Does he ill treat you?” I inquired.</p>

  <p>“His wife does,” she answered. “I am forced to do all manner of slavish
    work, and when my strength fails, I am urged on by blows. Oh! I do so
    fearfully dread the chilling winters, without proper food or clothing;
    and I long to lie down and die, if God’s mercy will only permit me to
    escape from this hopeless imprisonment. I have nothing to expect now.
    I<span class="pagenum">116</span> did once look forward to release, but that is all gone. I strove to
    go with the others, who were ransomed at Fort Pierre, and Mrs. Wright
    plead for me with all her heart; but the man who bought me would not
    give me up, and my prayers were useless.</p>

  <p>“Mr. Dupuy, a Frenchman, who brought a wagon for the redeemed women and
    children, did not offer enough for me; and when another man offered a
    horse my captor would not receive it.</p>

  <p>“There were many prisoners that I did not see in the village, but I
    am left alone. The Yanktons, who hold me, are friendly by pretense,
    and go to the agencies for supplies and annuities, but at heart they
    are bitterly hostile. They assert that, if they did not murder and
    steal, the Father at Washington would forget them; and now they receive
    presents and supplies to keep them in check, which they delight in
    taking, and deceiving the officers as to their share in the outbreaks.”</p>

  <p>Her dread of soldiers was such that she had never attempted to escape,
    nor did she seem to think it possible to get away from her present
    life, so deep was the despair into which long-continued suffering had
    plunged her.</p>

  <p>Sad as my condition was, I could not but pity poor Mary’s worse fate.
    The unwilling wife of a brutal savage, and subject to all the petty
    malice of a scarcely less brutal squaw, there could be no gleam of
    sunshine<span class="pagenum">117</span> in her future prospects. True, I was, like her, a captive,
    torn from home and friends, and subject to harsh treatment, but no such
    personal indignity had fallen to my lot.</p>

  <p>When Mary was first taken, she saw many terrible things, which she
    related to me, among which was the following:</p>

  <p>One day, the Indians went into a house where they found a woman making
    bread. Her infant child lay in the cradle, unconscious of its fate.
    Snatching it from its little bed they thrust it into the heated oven,
    its screams torturing the wretched mother, who was immediately after
    stabbed and cut in many pieces.</p>

  <p>Taking the suffering little creature from the oven, they then dashed
    out its brains against the walls of the house.</p>

  <p>One day, on their journey, they came to a narrow but deep stream of
    water. Some of the prisoners, and nearly all of the Indians, crossed on
    horseback, while a few crossed on logs, which had been cut down by the
    beaver. A lady (by name Mrs. Fletcher, I believe), who was in delicate
    health, fell into the water with her heavy burden, unable, on account
    of her condition, to cross, and was shot by the Indians, her lifeless
    body soon disappearing from sight. She also told me of a white man
    having been killed a few days previous, and a large sum of money taken
    from him, which would be exchanged for articles used among the Indians<span class="pagenum">118</span>
    when they next visited the Red River or British Possessions. They
    went, she told me, two or three times a year, taking American horses,
    valuables, etc., which they had stolen from the whites, and exchanging
    them for ammunition, powder, arrow points, and provisions.</p>

  <p>Before they reached the Missouri River they killed five of Mrs.
    Dooley’s children, one of which was left on the ground in a place
    where the distracted mother had to pass daily in carrying water from
    the river; and when they left the camp the body remained unburied. So
    terrible were the sufferings of this heart-broken mother, that, when
    she arrived in safety among the whites, her reason was dethroned, and I
    was told that she was sent to the lunatic asylum, where her distracted
    husband soon followed.</p>

  <p>Mary wished that we might be together, but knew that it would be
    useless to ask, as it would not be granted.</p>

  <p>I gave her my little book and half of my pencil, which she was glad to
    receive. I wrote her name in the book, together with mine, encouraging
    her with every kind word and hope of the future. She could read and
    write, and understood the Indian language thoroughly.</p>

  <p>The book had been taken from our wagon, and I had endeavored to teach
    the Indians from it, for it contained several stories; so it made the
    Indians very angry to have me part with it.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">119</span></p>

  <p>For hours I had sat with the book in my hands, showing them the
    pictures and explaining their meaning, which interested them greatly,
    and which helped pass away and relieve the monotony of the days of
    captivity which I was enduring. Moreover, it inspired them with a
    degree of respect and veneration for me when engaged in the task, which
    was not only pleasant, but a great comfort. It was by this means they
    discovered my usefulness in writing letters and reading for them.</p>

  <p>I found them apt pupils, willing to learn, and they learned easily and
    rapidly. Their memory is very retentive&mdash;unusually good.</p>

      DELIRIUM&mdash;A SHOWER OF GRASSHOPPERS&mdash;A FEAST AND A FIGHT&mdash;AN
      ENRAGED SQUAW&mdash;THE CHIEF WOUNDED.</div>
  </div>

  <p><span class="smcap">One</span> day, as I was pursuing what seemed to me an endless journey, an
    Indian rode up beside me, whom I did not remember to have seen before.</p>

  <p>At his saddle hung a bright and well-known little shawl, and from the
    other side was suspended a child’s scalp of long, fair hair.</p>

  <p>As my eyes rested on the frightful sight, I trembled in my saddle and
    grasped the air for support. A blood-red cloud seemed to come between
    me and the outer world, and I realized that innocent victim’s dying
    agonies.</p>

  <p>The torture was too great to be endured&mdash;a merciful insensibility
    interposed between me and madness.</p>

  <p>I dropped from the saddle as if dead, and rolled upon the ground at the
    horse’s feet.</p>

  <p>When I recovered, I was clinging to a squaw, who, with looks of
    astonishment and alarm, was vainly endeavoring to extricate herself
    from my clutches.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">121</span></p>

  <p>With returning consciousness, I raised my eyes to the fearful sight
    that had almost deprived me of reason; it was gone.</p>

  <p>The Indian had suspected the cause of my emotion, and removed it out of
    sight.</p>

  <p>They placed me in the saddle once more, and not being able to control
    the horrible misery I felt, I protested wildly against their touch,
    imploring them to kill me, and frantically inviting the death I had
    before feared and avoided.</p>

  <p>When they camped, I had not the power or reason to seek my own tent,
    but fell down in the sun, where the chief found me lying. He had been
    out at the head of a scouting party, and knew nothing of my sufferings.</p>

  <p>Instantly approaching me, he inquired who had misused me. I replied,
    “No one. I want to see my dear mother, my poor mother, who loves me,
    and pines for her unhappy child.”</p>

  <p>I had found, by experience, that the only grief with which this red
    nation had any sympathy was the sorrow one might feel for a separation
    from a mother, and even the chief seemed to recognize the propriety of
    such emotion.</p>

  <p>On this account I feigned to be grieving solely for my dear widowed
    mother, and was treated with more consideration than I had dared to
    expect.</p>

  <p>Leaving me for a few moments, he returned, bringing <span class="pagenum">122</span>me some ripe wild
    plums, which were deliciously cooling to my fever-parched lips.</p>

  <p>Hunger and thirst, sorrow and fear, with unusual fatigue and labor,
    had weakened me in mind and body, so that, after trying to realize the
    frightful vision that had almost deprived me of my senses, I began to
    waver in my knowledge of it, and half determined that it was a hideous
    phantom, like many another that had tortured my lonely hours.</p>

  <p>I tried to dismiss the awful dream from remembrance, particularly as
    the days that followed found me ill and delirious, and it was some time
    before I was able to recall events clearly.</p>

  <p>About this time there was another battle; and many having already sank
    under the united misery of hunger and fatigue, the camp was gloomy and
    hopeless in the extreme.</p>

  <p>The Indians discovered my skill in dressing wounds, and I was called
    immediately to the relief of the wounded brought into camp.</p>

  <p>The fight had lasted three days, and, from the immoderate lamentations,
    I supposed many had fallen, but could form no idea of the loss.</p>

  <p>Except when encamped for rest, the tribe pursued their wanderings
    constantly; sometimes flying before the enemy, at others endeavoring to
    elude them.</p>

  <p>I kept the record of time, as it passed with the savages, as well as I
    was able, and, with the exception <span class="pagenum">123</span>of a few days lost, during temporary
    delirium and fever at two separate times, and which I endeavored to
    supply by careful inquiry, I missed no count of the rising or setting
    sun, and knew dates almost as well as if I had been in the heart of
    civilization.</p>

  <p>One very hot day, a dark cloud seemed suddenly to pass before the sun
    and threaten a great storm. The wind rose, and the cloud became still
    darker, until the light of day was almost obscured.</p>

  <p>A few drops sprinkled the earth, and, then, in a heavy, blinding,
    and apparently inexhaustible shower, fell a countless swarm of
    grasshoppers, covering every thing and rendering the air almost black
    by their descent.</p>

  <p>It is impossible to convey an idea of their extent; they seemed to
    rival Pharaoh’s locusts in number, and no doubt would have done damage
    to the food of the savages had they not fallen victims themselves to
    their keen appetites.</p>

  <p>To catch them, large holes are dug in the ground, which are heated by
    fires. Into these apertures the insects are then driven, and, the fires
    having been removed, the heated earth bakes them.</p>

  <p>They are considered good food, and were greedily devoured by the
    famishing Sioux. Although the grasshoppers only remained two days, and
    went as suddenly as they had come, the Indians seemed refreshed<span class="pagenum">124</span> by
    feasting on such small game, and continued to move forward.</p>

  <p>Halting one day to rest beside good water, I busily engaged myself in
    the chief’s tipi, or lodge. I had grown so weak that motion of any kind
    was exhausting to me, and I could scarcely walk. I felt that I must
    soon die of starvation and sorrow, and life had ceased to be dear to me.</p>

  <p>Mechanically I tried to fulfill my tasks, so as to secure the continued
    protection of the old squaw, who, when not incensed by passion, was not
    devoid of kindness.</p>

  <p>My strength failed me, and I could not carry out my wishes, and almost
    fell as I tried to move around.</p>

  <p>This met with disapprobation, and, better fed than myself, she could
    not sympathize with my want of strength. She became cross, and left the
    lodge, threatening me with her vengeance.</p>

  <p>Presently an Indian woman, who pitied me, ran into the tipi in great
    haste, saying that her husband had got some deer meat, and she had
    cooked it for a feast, and begged me to share it. As she spoke, she
    drew me toward her tent, and, hungry and fainting, I readily followed.</p>

  <p>The chief saw us go, and, not disdaining a good dinner, he followed.
    The old squaw came flying into the lodge like an enraged fury,
    flourishing her knife, and vowing she would kill me.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">125</span></p>

  <p>I arose immediately and fled, the squaw pursuing me. The chief
    attempted to interfere, but her rage was too great, and he struck her,
    at which she sprang like an infuriated tiger upon him, stabbing him in
    several places.</p>

  <p>Her brother, who at a short distance beheld the fray, and deeming me
    the cause, fired six shots, determining to kill me. One of these shots
    lodged in the arm of the chief, breaking it near the shoulder. I then
    ran until I reached the outskirts of the village, where I was captured
    by a party who saw me running, but who knew not the cause.</p>

  <p>Thinking that I was endeavoring to escape, they dragged me in the tent,
    brandishing their tomahawks and threatening vengeance.</p>

  <p>After the lapse of half an hour some squaws came and took me back to
    the lodge of the chief, who was waiting for me, before his wounds could
    be dressed. He was very weak from loss of blood.</p>

  <p>I never saw the wife of the chief afterward.</p>

  <p>Indian surgery is coarse and rude in its details. A doctor of the tribe
    had pierced the arm of the chief with a long knife, probing in search
    of the ball it had received, and the wound thus enlarged had to be
    healed.</p>

  <p>As soon as I was able to stand, I was required to go and wait on the
    disabled chief. I found his three<span class="pagenum">126</span> sisters with him, and with these I
    continued to live in companionship.</p>

  <p>One of them had been married, at the fort, to a white man, whom she had
    left at Laramie when his prior wife arrived.</p>

  <p>She told me that they were esteemed friendly, and had often received
    supplies from the fort, although at heart they were always the enemy of
    the white man.</p>

  <p>“But will they not suspect you?” asked I. “They may discover your
    deceit and punish you some day.”</p>

  <p>She laughed derisively. “Our prisoners don’t escape to tell tales,” she
    replied. “Dead people don’t talk. We claim friendship, and they can not
    prove that we don’t feel it. Besides, all white soldiers are cowards.”</p>

  <p>Shudderingly I turned away from this enemy of my race, and prepared to
    wait on my captor, whose superstitious belief in the healing power of a
    white woman’s touch led him to desire her services.</p>

  <p>The wounds of the chief were severe, and the suppuration profuse. It
    was my task to bathe and dress them, and prepare his food.</p>

  <p>Hunting and fishing being now out of the question for him, he had sent
    his wives to work for themselves, keeping the sisters and myself to
    attend him.</p>

  <p>War with our soldiers seemed to have decreased the power of the chief
    to a great extent.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">127</span></p>

  <p>As he lay ill, he evidently meditated on some plan of strengthening
    his forces, and finally concluded to send an offer of marriage to the
    daughter of a war-chief of another band.</p>

  <p>As General Sully’s destructive attack had deprived him all ready
    offerings, he availed himself of my shoes, which happened to be
    particularly good, and, reducing me to moccasins, sent them as a gift
    to the expected bride.</p>

  <p>She evidently received them graciously, for she came to his lodge
    almost every day to visit him, and sat chatting at his side, to his
    apparent satisfaction.</p>

  <p>The pleasure of this new matrimonial acquisition on the part of the
    chief was very trying to me, on account of my limited wardrobe, for as
    the betrothed continued in favor, the chief evinced it by giving her
    articles of my clothing.</p>

  <p>An Indian woman had given me a red silk sash, such as officers wear.
    The chief unceremoniously cut it in half, leaving me one half, while
    the coquettish squaw received the rest.</p>

  <p>An Indian husband’s power is absolute, even to death.</p>

  <p>No woman can have more than one husband, but an Indian can have as many
    wives as he chooses.</p>

  <p>The marriage of the chief was to be celebrated with all due ceremony
    when his arm got well.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">128</span></p>

  <p>But his arm never recovered. Mr. Clemens, the interpreter, tells me (in
    my late interview with him), that he still remains crippled, and unable
    to carry out his murderous intentions, or any of his anticipated wicked
    designs.</p>

  <p>He is now living in the forts along the Missouri River, gladly claiming
    support from the Government.</p>

      BURIAL INCIDENT.</div>
  </div>

  <p><span class="smcap">Before</span> the Indians left this camping-ground, there arrived among us an
    Indian called Porcupine. He was well dressed, and mounted on a fine
    horse, and brought with him presents and valuables that insured him a
    cordial reception.</p>

  <p>After he had been a few days in the village, he gave me a letter
    from Captain Marshall, of the Eleventh Ohio Cavalry, detailing the
    unsuccessful attempts that had been made to rescue me, and stating that
    this friendly Indian had undertaken to bring me back, for which he
    would be rewarded.</p>

  <p>The letter further said that he had already received a horse and
    necessary provisions for the journey, and had left his three wives,
    with thirteen others, at the fort, as hostages.</p>

  <p>My feelings, on reading this letter, were indescribable. <span class="pagenum">130</span>My heart
    leaped with unaccustomed hope, at this evidence of the efforts of my
    white friends in my behalf; but the next instant, despair succeeded
    this gleam of happy anticipation, for I knew this faithless messenger
    would not be true to his promise, since he had joined the Sioux
    immediately after his arrival among them, in a battle against the
    whites.</p>

  <p>My fears were not unfounded. Porcupine prepared to go back to the fort
    without me, disregarding my earnest prayers and entreaties.</p>

  <p>The chief found me useful, and determined to keep me. He believed that
    a woman who had seen so much of their deceitfulness and cruelty could
    do them injury at the fort, and might prevent their receiving annuities.</p>

  <p>Porcupine said he should report me as dead, or impossible to find; nor
    could I prevail on him to do any thing to the contrary.</p>

  <p>When reminded of the possible vengeance of the soldiers on his wives,
    whom they had threatened to kill if he did not bring me back, he
    laughed.</p>

  <p>“The white soldiers are cowards,” he replied; “they never kill women;
    and I will deceive them as I have done before.”</p>

  <p>Saying this, he took his departure; nor could my most urgent entreaties
    induce the chief to yield his consent, and allow me to send a written
    message to my friends, or in any way assure them of my existence.<span class="pagenum">131</span> All
    hope of rescue departed, and sadly I turned again to the wearisome
    drudgery of my captive life.</p>

  <p>The young betrothed bride of the old chief was very gracious to me. On
    one occasion she invited me to join her in a walk. The day was cool,
    and the air temptingly balmy.</p>

  <p>“Down there,” she said, pointing to a deep ravine; “come and walk
    there; it is cool and shady.”</p>

  <p>I looked in the direction indicated, and then at the Indian girl, who
    became very mysterious in her manner, as she whispered:</p>

  <p>“There are white people down there.”</p>

  <p>“How far?” I asked, eagerly.</p>

  <p>“About fifty miles,” she replied. “They have great guns, and men
    dressed in many buttons; their wagons are drawn by horses with long
    ears.”</p>

  <p>A fort, thought I, but remembering the treacherous nature of the people
    I was among, I repressed every sign of emotion, and tried to look
    indifferent.</p>

  <p>“Should you like to see them?” questioned Egosegalonicha, as she was
    called.</p>

  <p>“They are strangers to me,” I said, quietly; “I do not know them.”</p>

  <p>“Are you sorry to live with us?”</p>

  <p>“You do not have such bread as I would like to eat,” replied I,
    cautiously.</p>

  <p>“And are you dissatisfied with our home?”</p>

  <p>“You have some meat now; it is better than that at<span class="pagenum">132</span> the other
    camping-ground. There we had no food, and I suffered.”</p>

  <p>“But your eyes are swollen and red,” hinted she; “you do not weep for
    bread.”</p>

  <p>These questions made me suspicious, and I tried to evade the young
    squaw, but in vain.</p>

  <p>“Just see how green that wood is,” I said, affecting not to hear her.</p>

  <p>“But you do not say you are content,” repeated she. “Will you stay here
    always, willingly?”</p>

  <p>“Come and listen to the birds,” said I, drawing my companion toward the
    grove.</p>

  <p>I did not trust her, and feared to utter a single word, lest it might
    be used against me with the chief.</p>

  <p>Neither was I mistaken in the design of Egosegalonicha, for when we
    returned to the lodge, I overheard her relating to the chief the
    amusement she had enjoyed, in lying to the white woman, repeating what
    she had said about the fort, and inventing entreaties which I had
    used, urging her to allow me to fly to my white friends, and leave the
    Indians forever.</p>

  <p>Instantly I resolved to take advantage of the affair as a joke, and,
    approaching the chief with respectful pleasantry, begged to reverse the
    story.</p>

  <p>“It was the squaw who had implored me to go with her to the white man’s
    fort,” I said, “and find her a white warrior for a husband; but, true to
    my faith with the Indians, I refused.”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">133</span></p>

  <p>The wily Egosegalonicha, thus finding her weapons turned against
    herself, appeared confused, and suddenly left the tent, at which the
    old chief smiled grimly.</p>

  <p>Slander, like a vile serpent, coils itself among these Indian women;
    and, as with our fair sisters in civilized society, when reality fails,
    invention is called in to supply the defect. They delight in scandal,
    and prove by it their claim to some of the refined conventionalities of
    civilized life.</p>

  <p>Porcupine had spread the news abroad in the village that a large reward
    had been offered for the white woman, consequently I was sought for,
    the motive being to gain the reward.</p>

  <p>One day an Indian, whom I had seen in different places, and whose wife
    I had known, made signs intimating a desire for my escape, and assuring
    me of his help to return to my people.</p>

  <p>I listened to his plans, and although I knew my position in such a case
    to be one of great peril; yet I felt continually that my life was of so
    little value that any opportunity, however slight, was as a star in the
    distance, and escape should be attempted, even at a risk.</p>

  <p>We conversed as well as we could several times, and finally
    arrangements were made. At night he was to make a slight scratching
    noise at the tipi where I was, as a sign. The night came, but I was
    singing to the people, and could not get away. Another time we had
    visitors in the lodge, and I would be missed. The<span class="pagenum">134</span> next night I arose
    from my robe, and went out into the darkness. Seeing my intended
    rescuer at a short distance, I approached and followed him. We ran
    hastily out of the village about a mile, where we were to be joined by
    the squaw who had helped make the arrangements and was favorable to
    the plan for my escape, but she was not there. White Tipi (that was
    the Indian’s name) looked hastily around, and, seeing no one, darted
    suddenly away, without a word of explanation. Why the Indian acted thus
    I never knew. It was a strange proceeding.</p>

  <p>Fear lent me wings, and I flew, rather than ran, back to my tipi, or
    lodge, where, exhausted and discouraged, I dropped on the ground and
    feigned slumber, for the inmates were already aroused, having just
    discovered my absence. Finding me apparently asleep, they lifted me up,
    and taking me into the tent, laid me upon my own robe.</p>

  <p>The next evening White Tipi sent for me to come to his lodge, to a
    feast, where I was well and hospitably entertained, but not a sign
    given of the adventure of the previous night. But when the pipe was
    passed, he requested it to be touched to my lips, then offered it to
    the Great Spirit, thus signifying his friendship for me.</p>

  <p>In this month the Indians captured a white man, who was hunting on the
    prairie, and carried him far away from the haunts of white men, where
    they tied<span class="pagenum">135</span> him hand and foot, after divesting him of all clothing, and
    left him to starve. He was never heard of afterward.</p>

  <p>There were twin children in one of the lodges, one of which sickened
    and died, and in the evening was buried. The surviving child was placed
    upon the scaffold by the corpse, and there remained all night, its
    crying and moaning almost breaking my heart. I inquired why they did
    this. The reply was, to cause the mate to mourn. The mother was on one
    of the neighboring hills, wailing and weeping, as is the custom among
    them. Every night nearly, there were women among the hills, wailing for
    their dead.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">About</span> the 1st of October the Indians were on the move as usual, and
    by some means I became separated from the family I was with, and was
    lost. I looked around for them, but their familiar faces were not to be
    seen. Strangers gazed upon me, and, although I besought them to assist
    me in finding the people of my own tipi, they paid no attention to my
    trouble, and refused to do any thing for me.</p>

  <p>Never shall I forget the sadness I felt as evening approached, and we
    encamped for the night in a lonely valley, after a wearisome day’s
    journey.</p>

  <p>Along one side stood a strip of timber, with a small stream beside it.
    Hungry, weary, and lost to my people, with no place to lay my head, and
    after a fruitless search for the family, I was more desolate than ever.
    Even Keoku, or “Yellow Bird,” the Indian <span class="pagenum">137</span>girl who had been given me,
    was not with me that day, making it still more lonely.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">

  </div>

  <p>I sat down and held my pony. It was autumn, and the forest wore the
    last glory of its gorgeous coloring. Already the leaves lay along
    the paths, like a rich carpet of variegated colors. The winds caught
    a deeper tone, mournful as the tones of an Æolian harp, but the air
    was balmy and soft, and the sunlight lay warm and pleasant, as in
    midsummer, over the beautiful valley, now occupied with numberless
    camps of tentless Indians. It seemed as if the soft autumn weather was,
    to the last moment, unwilling to yield the last traces of beauty to
    the chill embraces of stern winter, and I thought of the luxuries and
    comforts of my home. I looked back on the past with tears of sorrow
    and regret; my heart was overburdened with grief, and I prayed to die.
    The future looked like a dark cloud approaching, for the dread of the
    desolation of winter to me was appalling.</p>

  <p>While meditating on days of the past, and contemplating the future,
    Keoku came suddenly upon me, and was delighted to find the object of
    her search.</p>

  <p>They had been looking for me, and did not know where I had gone, were
    quite worried about me, she said, and she was glad she had found me. I
    was as pleased as herself, and rejoiced to join them.</p>

  <p>One has no idea of the extent of an Indian village, or of the number of
    its inhabitants.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">138</span></p>

  <p>It would seem strange to some that I should ever get lost when
    among them, but, like a large city, one may be separated from their
    companions, and in a few moments be lost.</p>

  <p>The Indians all knew the “white woman,” but I knew but few
    comparatively, and consequently when among strangers I felt utterly
    friendless.</p>

  <p>The experience of those days of gloom and sadness seem like a fearful
    dream, now that my life is once again with civilized people, and
    enjoying the blessings that I was there deprived of.</p>

  <p>Some twenty-five years ago an emigrant train, en route for California,
    arrived in the neighborhood of the crossing of the North Platte, and
    the cholera broke out among the travelers, and every one died, with the
    exception of one little girl.</p>

  <p>The Indian “Black Bear,” while hunting, came to the wagons, now a
    morgue, and, finding the father of the girl dying with cholera, took
    the child in his arms. The dying parent begged him to carry his little
    one to his home in the East, assuring him of abundant reward by the
    child’s friends, in addition to the gold he gave him. These facts I
    gleaned from a letter given to Black Bear by the dying father, and
    which had been carefully preserved by the daughter.</p>

  <p>Instead of doing as was desired, he took the money, child, and every
    thing valuable in the train, to his own<span class="pagenum">139</span> home among the hills, and
    there educated the little one with habits of savage life.</p>

  <p>She forgot her own language, her name, and every thing about her
    past life, but she knew that she was white. Her infancy and girlhood
    were, therefore, passed in utter ignorance of the modes of life of
    her own people, and, contented and happy, she remained among them,
    verifying the old adage, that “habit is second nature.” When she was
    of marriageable age, Black Bear took her for his wife, and they had a
    child, a boy.</p>

  <p>I became acquainted with this white woman shortly after I went into
    the village, and we were sincere friends, although no confidants, as I
    dared not trust her. It was very natural and pleasant also to know her,
    as she was white, and although she was an Indian in tastes and habits,
    she was my sister, and belonged to my people; there was a sympathetic
    chord between us, and it was a relief to be with her.</p>

  <p>On the occasion of my first visit with her, Black Bear suggested the
    idea that white women always drank tea together, so she made us a cup
    of herb tea, which we drank in company.</p>

  <p>I endeavored to enlighten her, and to do her all the good I could; told
    her of the white people, and of their kindness and Christianity, trying
    to impress her with the superiority of the white race, all of which she
    listened to with great interest.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">140</span></p>

  <p>I was the only white woman she had seen, for whenever they neared any
    fort she was always kept out of sight.</p>

  <p>She seemed to enjoy painting herself, and dressing for the dances,
    as well as the squaws, and was happy and contented with Indian
    surroundings, for she knew no difference.</p>

  <p>I know not what has become of her, for I have never heard; neither can
    I remember the name of her father, which was in the note handed the
    Indian by his dying hand.</p>

  <p>A little boy, fourteen years old, whose name was Charles Sylvester,
    belonging in Quincy, Illinois, who was stolen when seven years of age,
    was in the village, and one day I saw him playing with the Indian boys,
    and, discovering immediately that he was a white boy, I flew to his
    side, and tried to clasp him in my arms, in my joy exclaiming, “Oh!
    I know you are a white boy! Speak to me, and tell me who you are and
    where you come from?” He also had forgotten his name and parentage, but
    knew that he was white.</p>

  <p>When I spoke to him, the boys began to plague and tease him, and he
    refused to speak to me, running away every time I approached him.</p>

  <p>One year after, one day, when this boy was out hunting, he killed a
    comrade by accident, and he dared not return to the village; so he
    escaped, on his pony, to the white people. On his way to the States,
    he called<span class="pagenum">141</span> at a house where they knew what Indians he belonged to, and
    they questioned him, whether he had seen a white woman in the village;
    he replied in the affirmative, and a bundle of pictures being given
    him, he picked mine out from among them, saying, “That is the white
    woman whom I saw.”</p>

  <p>After awhile, being discontented with his own people, he returned to
    his adopted friends on the North Platte, and became an interpreter and
    trader, and still remains there, doing business at various posts.</p>

  <p>When the Indians went to obtain their annuities, they transferred me
    to the Unkpapas, leaving me in their charge, where there was a young
    couple, and an old Indian, who had four wives; he had been very brave,
    it was said, for he had endured the trial which proves the successful
    warrior. He was one of those who “looked at the sun” without failing in
    heart or strength.</p>

  <p>This custom is as follows: The one who undergoes this operation is
    nearly naked, and is suspended from the upper end of a pole by a cord,
    which is tied to some splints which run through the flesh of both
    breasts. The weight of his body is hung from it, the feet still upon
    the ground helping support it a very little, and in his left hand
    he holds his favorite bow, and in his right, with a firm hold, his
    medicine bag.</p>

  <p>A great crowd usually looks on, sympathizing with and encouraging him,
    but he still continues to hang and<span class="pagenum">142</span> “look at the sun,” without paying
    the least attention to any one about him. The mystery men beat their
    drums, and shake their rattles, and sing as loud as they can yell,
    to strengthen his heart to look at the sun from its rising until its
    setting, at which time, if his heart and strength have not failed
    him, he is “cut down,” receives a liberal donation of presents, which
    are piled before him during the day, and also the name and style of
    a doctor, or medicine man, which lasts him, and insures him respect,
    through life. It is considered a test of bravery. Superstition seems
    to have full sway among the Indians&mdash;just as much as in heathen
    lands beyond the sea, where the Burmah mother casts her child to the
    crocodile to appease the Great Spirit.</p>

  <p>Many of these Indians were from Minnesota, and were of the number that
    escaped justice two years before, after committing an indiscriminate
    slaughter of men, women, and children. One day, I was sent for by
    one of them, and when I was seated in his lodge, he gave me a letter
    to read, which purported to have been written by General Sibley, as
    follows:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“This Indian, after taking part in the present outbreak of the Indians
      against the white settlers and missionaries, being sick, and not able
      to keep up with his friends in their flight, we give you the offerings
      of friendship, food and clothing. You are in our power, but we won’t
      harm you. Go to your people and gladden their hearts. Lay down your
      weapons, and fight the<span class="pagenum">143</span> white men no more. We will do you good, and not
      evil. Take this letter; in it we have spoken. Depart in peace, and ever
      more be a friend to the white people, and you will be more happy.”</p>

    <div class="large right pr10">H. H. SIBLEY,</div>
    <div class="right"><i>Brig.-Gen., Commanding Expedition</i>.</div>
  </blockquote>


  <p>Instinctively I looked up into his face, and said: “Intend to keep
    your promise?” He laughed derisively at the idea of an Indian brave
    abandoning his profession. He told of many instances of outrageous
    cruelties of his band in their marauding and murderous attacks on
    traveling parties and frontier settlers; and, further, to assure me of
    his bravery, he showed me a puzzle or game he had made from the finger
    bones of some of the victims that had fallen beneath his own tomahawk.
    The bones had been freed from the flesh by boiling, and, being placed
    upon a string, were used for playing some kind of Indian game. This is
    but one of the heathenish acts of these Indians.</p>

  <p>The Indians are fond of recounting their exploits, and, savage like,
    dwell with much satisfaction upon the number of scalps they have taken
    from their white foes. They would be greatly amused at the shuddering
    horror manifested, when, to annoy me, they would tauntingly portray the
    dying agonies of white men, women, and children, who had fallen into
    their hands;<span class="pagenum">144</span> and especially would the effect of their description of
    the murder of little Mary afford them satisfaction. I feel, now, that I
    must have been convinced of her death, yet I could not then help hoping
    that she had escaped.</p>

  <p>These exploits and incidents are generally related by the Indians,
    when in camp having nothing to do. The great lazy brutes would sit by
    the hour, making caricatures of white soldiers, representing them in
    various ways, and always as cowards and inferior beings; sometimes
    as in combat, but always at their mercy. This was frequently done,
    apparently to annoy me, and one day, losing patience, I snatched a
    rude drawing from the hands of an Indian, who was holding it up to my
    view, and tore it in two, clasping the part that represented the white
    soldier to my heart, and throwing the other in the fire. Then, looking
    up, I told them the white soldiers were dear to me; that they were my
    friends, and I loved them. I said they were friends to the Indians, and
    did not want to harm them. I expressed myself in the strongest manner
    by words and signs.</p>

  <p>Never did I see a more enraged set of men. They assailed me with
    burning fire-brands, burning me severely. They heated the points of
    arrows, and burned and threatened me sorely.</p>

  <p>I told them I meant no harm to them. That it was ridiculous, their
    getting angry at my burning a bit of<span class="pagenum">145</span> paper. I promised I would
    make them some more; that they should have pictures of my drawing,
    when, at last, I pacified them. They were much like children in this
    respect&mdash;easily offended, but very difficult to please.</p>

  <p>I was constantly annoyed, worried, and terrified by their strange
    conduct&mdash;their transition from laughing and fun to anger, and even
    rage. I knew not how to get along with them. One moment, they would
    seem friendly and kind; the next, if any act of mine displeased them,
    their faces were instantly changed, and they displayed their hatred
    or anger in unmeasured words or conduct&mdash;children one hour, the next,
    fiends. I always tried to please them, and was as cheerful as I could
    be under the circumstances, for my own sake.</p>

  <p>One day, I was called to see a man who lay in his tipi in great
    suffering. His wasted face was darkened by fever, and his brilliantly
    restless eyes rolled anxiously, as if in search of relief from pain.
    He was reduced to a skeleton, and had endured tortures from the
    suppuration of an old wound in the knee.</p>

  <p>He greeted me with the “How! how!” of Indian politeness, and, in answer
    to my inquiry why he came to suffer so, replied:</p>

  <p>“I go to fight white man. He take away land, and chase game away; then
    he take away our squaws. He take away my best squaw.”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">146</span></p>

  <p>Here his voice choked, and he displayed much emotion.</p>

  <p>Pitying his misery, I endeavored to aid him, and rendered him all the
    assistance in my power, but death was then upon him.</p>

  <p>The medicine man was with him also, practicing his incantations.</p>

  <p>We were so constantly traveling, it wearied me beyond expression. The
    day after the Indian’s burial we were again on the move.</p>

      WHISKY&mdash;A DRUNKEN DEBAUCH&mdash;I WRITE A LETTER TO CAPTAIN FISK
      UNDER DICTATION&mdash;POISONED INDIANS&mdash;THE TRAIN SAVED BY MY
      CLERICAL STRATEGY.</div>
  </div>

  <p><span class="smcap">One</span> of the occupations given me, while resting in the villages between
    war times, was to prepare the bark of a red willow called killikinnick,
    for smoking instead of tobacco.</p>

  <p>They discovered that I could sing, and groups of idle warriors would
    gather around me before the tent, urging me to sing as I worked. A
    dreary, dreary task! chanting to please my savage companions while I
    rubbed and prepared the bark of willow, my heart ready to burst with
    grief.</p>

  <p>On the 5th of September they went to battle, and surprised a portion
    of Captain Fisk’s men passing in escorting an emigrant train&mdash;fourteen
    of whom they killed, and captured two wagons loaded with whisky,
    wines, and valuable articles. There was a quantity of silver-ware and
    stationery also taken by them.</p>

  <p>Among the articles captured and brought into camp<span class="pagenum">148</span> were a number of
    pickles in glass jars, which the Indians tasted. The result was comical
    in the extreme, for there is nothing that an Indian abhors more than
    a strong acid. The faces they made can be imagined but not described.
    Thinking they might be improved by cooking, they placed the jars in the
    fire, when of course they exploded, very much to their disgust for the
    “white man’s kettles.”</p>

  <p>I could hear the firing plainly, and when they returned that night in
    triumph, bringing with them the plundered stores, they committed every
    description of extravagant demonstration. In the wild orgies which
    followed, they mocked and groaned in imitation of the dying, and went
    through a horrid mimicry of the butchery they had perpetrated.</p>

  <p>They determined to go out again, and capture a quantity of horses
    corralled in the neighborhood, and sweep the train and soldiers with
    wholesale massacre; but they feared the white man’s cannon, and
    deliberated on means of surprising by ambush, which is their only idea
    of warfare.</p>

  <p>Indians are not truly brave, though they are vain of the name of
    courage. Cunning, stealth, strategy, and deceit are the weapons they
    use in attack.</p>

  <p>They endure pain, because they are taught from infancy that it is
    cowardly to flinch, but they will never stand to fight if they can
    strike secretly and escape.</p>

  <p>Fearing the cannon, yet impatient for the spoil<span class="pagenum">149</span> almost within view,
    the Indians waited for three days for the train to move on and leave
    them free to attack.</p>

  <p>For two days I implored and begged on my knees to be allowed to go with
    them, but to no avail. At last I succeeded in inducing them to allow me
    to write, as they knew I understood the nature of correspondence, and
    they procured for me the necessary appliances and dictated a letter to
    Captain Fisk, assuring him that the Indians were weary of fighting, and
    advising him to go on in peace and safety.</p>

  <p>Knowing their malicious designs, I set myself to work to circumvent
    them; and although the wily chief counted every word dictated, and
    as they were marked on paper, I contrived, by joining them together,
    and condensing the information I gave, to warn the officer of the
    perfidious intentions of the savages, and tell him briefly of my
    helpless and unhappy captivity.</p>

  <p>The letter was carefully examined by the chief, and the number of its
    apparent words recounted.</p>

  <p>At length, appearing satisfied with its contents, he had it carried to
    a hill in sight of the soldier’s camp, and stuck on a pole.</p>

  <p>In due time the reply arrived, and again my ingenuity was tasked to
    read the answer corresponding with the number of words, that would not
    condemn me.</p>

  <p>The captain’s real statement was, that he distrusted all among the
    savages, and had great reason to.</p>

  <p>On reading Captain Fisk’s words, that seemed to<span class="pagenum">150</span> crush my already
    awakened hopes, my emotion overcame me.</p>

  <p>Having told the Indians that the captain doubted their friendliness,
    and explained the contents of the letter as I thought best, the next
    day I was entrusted with the task of writing again, to solemnly assure
    the soldiers of the faith and friendship professed.</p>

  <p>Again I managed to communicate with them, and this time begged them to
    use their field-glasses, and that I would find an excuse for standing
    on the hills in the afternoon, that they might see for themselves that
    I was what I represented myself to be&mdash;a white woman held in bondage.</p>

  <p>The opportunity I desired was gained, and to my great delight, I had a
    chance of standing so as to be seen by the men of the soldier’s camp.</p>

  <p>I had given my own name in every communication. As soon as the soldiers
    saw that it truly was a woman of their own race, and that I was in the
    power of their enemies, the excitement of their feelings became so
    great that they desired immediately to rush to my rescue.</p>

  <p>A gentleman belonging to the train generously offered eight hundred
    dollars for my ransom, which was all the money he had, and the noble,
    manly feeling displayed in my behalf did honor to those who felt it.
    There was not a man in the train who was not willing to sacrifice all
    he had for my rescue.</p>

  <p>Captain Fisk restrained all hasty demonstrations,<span class="pagenum">151</span> and even went so
    far as to say that the first man who moved in the direction of the
    Indian camp should be shot immediately, his experience enabling him to
    know that a move of that kind would result fatally to them and to the
    captive.</p>

  <p>The Indians found a box of crackers saturated with water, and, eating
    of them, sickened and died.</p>

  <p>I afterward learned that some persons with the train who had suffered
    the loss of dear relatives and friends in the massacre of Minnesota,
    and who had lost their all, had poisoned the crackers with strychnine,
    and left them on one of their camping-grounds without the captain’s
    knowledge.</p>

  <p>The Indians told me afterward that more had died from eating bad bread
    than from bullets during the whole summer campaign.</p>

  <p>Captain Fisk deserves great credit for his daring and courage, with his
    meager supply of men, against so large an army of red men.</p>

  <p>After assurance of my presence among them, Captain Fisk proceeded to
    treat quietly with the savages on the subject of a ransom, offering to
    deliver in their village three wagon loads of stores as a price for
    their prisoner.</p>

  <p>To this the deceitful creatures pretended readily to agree, and the
    tortured captive, understanding their tongue, heard them making fun of
    the credulity of white soldiers who believed their promises.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">152</span></p>

  <p>I had the use of a field-glass from the Indians, and with it I saw my
    white friends, which almost made me wild with excited hope.</p>

  <p>Knowing what the Indians had planned, and dreading lest the messengers
    should be killed, as I knew they would be if they came to the village,
    I wrote to Captain Fisk of the futility of ransoming me in that way,
    and warned him of the treachery intended against his messengers.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

  <div class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a>
    The original letters written by me to Captain Fisk are
    now on file in the War Department at Washington. Officially certified
    extracts from the correspondence are published elsewhere in this work.
  </div>

  <p>No tongue can tell or pen describe those terrible days, when, seemingly
    lost to hope and surrounded by drunken Indians, my life was in constant
    danger.</p>

  <p>Nights of horrible revelry passed, when, forlorn and despairing, I
    lay listening, only half consciously, to the savage mirth and wild
    exultation.</p>

  <p>To no overtures would the Indians listen, declaring I could not
    be purchased at any price&mdash;they were determined not to part with
    me. Captain Fisk and his companions were sadly disappointed in not
    obtaining my release, and, after a hopeless attempt, he made known the
    fact of my being a prisoner, spreading the news far and wide.</p>

  <p>His expeditions across the plains had always been successful, and the
    Indians, knowing him to be very <span class="pagenum">153</span>brave, gave him the name of the “Great
    Chief, who knows no fear,” and he richly deserves the appellation, for
    the expeditions were attended with great danger. The reports of his
    various expeditious have been published by Government, and are very
    interesting, giving a description of the country.</p>

  <p>In September the rains were very frequent, sometimes continuing for
    days.</p>

  <p>This may not seem serious to those who have always been accustomed to
    a dwelling and a good bed, but to me, who had no shelter and whose
    shrinking form was exposed to the pitiless storm, and nought but the
    cold ground to lie upon, bringing the pains and distress of rheumatism,
    it was a calamity hard to bear, and I often prayed fervently to God to
    give me sweet release in a flight to the land where there are no storms.</p>

  <p>Soon the winter would be upon us, and the cold, and sleet, and stormy
    weather would be more difficult to bear. Would I be so fortunate,
    would Heaven be so gracious as to place me in circumstances where the
    wintry winds could not chill or make me suffer! My heart seemed faint
    at the thought of what was before me, for hope was lessening as winter
    approached!</p>

    <div class="subheadc">SCENES ON CANNON BALL PRAIRIE&mdash;REFLECTIONS.</div>
  </div>

  <p><span class="smcap">Well</span> do I remember my thoughts and feelings when first I beheld
    the mighty and beautiful prairie of Cannon Ball River. With what
    singular emotions I beheld it for the first time! I could compare it
    to nothing but a vast sea, changed suddenly to earth, with all its
    heaving, rolling billows; thousands of acres lay spread before me
    like a mighty ocean, bounded by nothing but the deep blue sky. What a
    magnificent sight&mdash;a sight that made my soul expand with lofty thought
    and its frail tenement sink into utter nothingness before it! Well do I
    remember my sad thoughts and the turning of my mind upon the past, as
    I stood alone upon a slight rise of ground, and overlooked miles upon
    miles of the most lovely, the most sublime scene I had ever beheld.
    Wave upon wave of land stretched away on every hand, covered with
    beautiful green grass and the blooming wild flowers of the prairie.
    Occasionally I caught glimpses of wild animals, while flocks of birds
    of various kinds and beautiful plumage skimming over the surface here
    and<span class="pagenum">155</span> there, alighting or darting upward from the earth, added life and
    beauty and variety to this most enchanting scene.</p>

  <p>It had been a beautiful day, and the sun was now just burying himself
    in the far-off ocean of blue, and his golden rays were streaming along
    the surface of the waving grass and tinging it with a delightful hue.
    Occasionally some elevated point caught and reflected back his rays
    to the one I was standing upon, and it would catch, for a moment, his
    fading rays, and glow like a ball of golden fire. Slowly he took his
    diurnal farewell, as if loth to quit a scene so lovely, and at last hid
    himself from my view beyond the western horizon.</p>

  <p>I stood and marked every change with that poetical feeling of pleasant
    sadness which a beautiful sunset rarely fails to awaken in the breast
    of the lover of nature. I noted every change that was going on, and yet
    my thoughts were far, far away. I thought of the hundreds of miles that
    separated me from the friends that I loved. I was recalling the delight
    with which I had, when a little girl, viewed the farewell scenes of
    day from so many romantic hills, and lakes, and rivers, rich meadows,
    mountain gorge and precipice, and the quiet hamlets of my dear native
    land so far away. I fancied I could see my mother move to the door,
    with a slow step and heavy heart, and gaze, with yearning affection,
    toward the broad, the mighty West, and sigh, wondering what had become
    of her lost child.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">156</span></p>

  <p>I thought, and grew more sad as I thought, until tears filled my eyes.</p>

  <p>Mother! what a world of affection is comprised in that single word; how
    little do we in the giddy round of youthful pleasure and folly heed
    her wise counsels; how lightly do we look upon that zealous care with
    which she guides our otherwise erring feet, and watches with feelings
    which none but a mother can know the gradual expansion of our youth
    to the riper years of discretion. We may not think of it then, but it
    will be recalled to our minds in after years, when the gloomy grave,
    or a fearful living separation, has placed her far beyond our reach,
    and her sweet voice of sympathy and consolation for the various ills
    attendant upon us sounds in our ears no more. How deeply then we regret
    a thousand deeds that we have done contrary to her gentle admonitions!
    How we sigh for those days once more, that we may retrieve what we have
    done amiss and make her kind heart glad with happiness! Alas! once
    gone, they can never be recalled, and we grow mournfully sad with the
    bitter reflection.</p>

  <p>“O, my mother!” I cried aloud, “my dearly beloved mother! Would I ever
    behold her again? should I ever return to my native land? Would I
    find her among the living? If not, if not, heavens! what a sad, what
    a painful thought!” and instantly I found my eyes swimming in tears
    and my frame trembling with nervous agitation. But I would hope for
    the<span class="pagenum">157</span> best. Gradually I became calm; then I thought of my husband, and
    what might be his fate. It was sad at best, I well knew. And lastly,
    though I tried to avoid it, I thought of Mary; sweet, lost, but
    dearly beloved Mary; I could see her gentle features; I could hear
    her plaintive voice, soft and silvery as running waters, and sighed
    a long, deep sigh as I thought of her murdered. Could I never behold
    her again? No; she was dead, perished by the cruel, relentless savage.
    Silence brooded over the world; not a sound broke the solemn repose
    of nature; the summer breeze had rocked itself to rest in the willow
    boughs, and the broad-faced, familiar moon seemed alive and toiling as
    it climbed slowly up a cloudless sky, passing starry sentinels, whose
    nightly challenge was lost in vast vortices of blue as they paced their
    ceaseless round in the mighty camp of constellations. With my eyes
    fixed upon my gloomy surroundings of tyranny, occasionally a slip of
    moonshine silvered the ground. I watched and reflected. Oh, hallowed
    days of my blessed girlhood! They rise before me now like holy burning
    stars breaking out in a stormy, howling night, making the blackness
    blacker still. The short, happy spring-time of life, so full of noble
    aspirations, and glowing hopes of my husband’s philanthropic schemes of
    charitable projects in the future.</p>

  <p>We had planned so much for the years to come, when, prosperous and
    happy, we should be able to<span class="pagenum">158</span> distribute some happiness among those
    whose fate might be mingled with ours, and in the pursuit of our daily
    avocations we would find joy and peace. But, alas! for human hopes and
    expectations!</p>

  <p>It is thus with our life. We silently glide along, little dreaming of
    the waves which will so soon sweep over us, dashing us against the
    rocks, or stranding us forever. We do not dream that we shall ever
    wreck, until the greater wave comes over us, and we bend beneath its
    power.</p>

  <p>If some mighty hand could unroll the future to our gaze, or set aside
    the veil which enshrouds it, what pictures would be presented to our
    trembling hearts? No; let it be as the All-wise hath ordained&mdash;a
    closed-up tomb, only revealed as the events occur, for could we bear
    them with the fortitude we should if they were known beforehand?
    Shrinking from it, we would say, “Let the cup pass from me.”</p>

    <div class="subheadc">A PRAIRIE ON FIRE&mdash;SCENES OF TERROR.</div>
  </div>

  <p><span class="smcap">In</span> October, we were overtaken by a prairie fire. At this season of the
    year the plants and grass, parched by a hot sun, are ready to blaze in
    a moment if ignited by the least spark, which is often borne on the
    wind from some of the many camp fires.</p>

  <p>With frightful rapidity we saw it extend in all directions, but we were
    allowed time to escape.</p>

  <p>The Indians ran like wild animals from the flames, uttering yells like
    demons; and great walls of fire from the right hand and from the left
    advanced toward us, hissing, crackling, and threatening to unite and
    swallow us up in their raging fury.</p>

  <p>We were amid calcined trees, which fell with a thundering crash,
    blinding us with clouds of smoke, and were burned by the showers of
    sparks, which poured upon us from all directions.</p>

  <p>The conflagration assumed formidable proportions; the forest shrunk
    up in the terrible grasp of the flames, and the prairie presented one
    sheet of fire, in the midst of which the wild animals, driven from
    their dens and<span class="pagenum">160</span> hiding-places by this unexpected catastrophe, ran about
    mad with terror.</p>

  <p>The sky gleamed with blood-red reflection; and the impetuous wind swept
    both flames and smoke before it.</p>

  <p>The Indians were terrified in the extreme on seeing around them
    the mountain heights lighted up like beacons; to show the entire
    destruction. The earth became hot, while immense troops of buffalo made
    the ground tremble with their furious tread, and their bellowings of
    despair would fill with terror the hearts of the bravest men.</p>

  <p>Every one was frightened, running about the camp as if struck by
    insanity.</p>

  <p>The fire continued to advance majestically, as it were, swallowing up
    every thing in its way, preceded by countless animals of various kinds,
    that bounded along with howls of fear, pursued by the scourge, which
    threatened to overtake them at every step.</p>

  <p>A thick smoke, laden with sparks, was already passing over the camp.
    Ten minutes more, and all would be over with us, I thought, when I saw
    the squaws pressing the children to their bosoms.</p>

  <p>The Indians had been deprived of all self-possession by the presence of
    our imminent peril&mdash;the flames forming an immense circle, of which our
    camp had become the center.</p>

  <p>But fortunately, the strong breeze which, up to that<span class="pagenum">161</span> moment, had lent
    wings to the conflagration, suddenly subsided, and there was not a
    breath of air stirring.</p>

  <p>The progress of the fire slackened. Providence seemed to grant us time.</p>

  <p>The camp presented a strange aspect. On bended knee, and with clasped
    hands, I prayed fervently. The fire continued to approach, with its
    vanguard of wild beasts.</p>

  <p>The Indians, old and young, male and female, began to pull up the grass
    by the roots all about the camp, then lassoed the horses and hobbled
    them in the center, and, in a few moments, a large space was cleared,
    where the herbs and grass had been pulled up with the feverish rapidity
    which all display in the fear of death.</p>

  <p>Some of the Indians went to the extremity of the space, where the grass
    had been pulled up, and formed a pile of grass and plants with their
    feet; then, with their flint, set fire to the mass, and thus caused
    “fire to fight fire,” as they called it. This was done in different
    directions. A curtain of flames rose rapidly around us, and for some
    time the camp was almost concealed beneath a vault of fire.</p>

  <p>It was a moment of intense and awful anxiety. By degrees the flames
    became less fierce, the air purer; the smoke dispersed, the roaring
    diminished, and, at length, we were able to recognize each other in
    this horrible chaos.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">162</span></p>

  <p>A sigh of relief burst from every heart. Our camp was saved! After the
    first moments of joy were over, the camp was put in order, and all felt
    the necessity of repose, after the terrible anxieties of the preceding
    hours; and also to give the ground time enough to cool, so that it
    might be traveled over by people and horses.</p>

  <p>The next day we prepared for departure. Tents were folded, and packages
    were placed upon the ponies, and our caravan was soon pursuing its
    journey, under the direction of the chief, who rode in advance of our
    band.</p>

  <p>The appearance of the prairie was much changed since the previous
    evening. In many places the black and burnt earth was a heap of smoking
    ashes; scarred and charred trees, still standing, displayed their
    saddening skeletons. The fire still roared at a distance, and the
    horizon was still obscured by smoke.</p>

  <p>The horses advanced with caution over the uneven ground, constantly
    stumbling over the bones of animals that had fallen victims to the
    embrace of the flames.</p>

  <p>The course we took in traveling wound along a narrow ravine, the dried
    bed of some torrent, deeply inclosed between two hills. The ground
    trodden by the horses was composed of round pebbles, which slipped
    from under their feet, augmenting the difficulty of the march, which
    was rendered still more toilsome to me<span class="pagenum">163</span> by the rays of the sun falling
    directly upon my uncovered head and face.</p>

  <p>The day passed away thus, and, aside from the fatigue which oppressed
    me, the day’s journey was unbroken by any incident.</p>

  <p>At evening, we again camped in a plain, absolutely bare; but in
    the distance we could see an appearance of verdure, affording
    great consolation, for we were about to enter a spot spared by the
    conflagration.</p>

  <p>At sunrise, next morning, we were on the march toward this oasis in the
    desert.</p>

    <div class="subhead">LAST DAYS WITH THE OGALALLA SIOUX&mdash;MASSACRE OF A PARTY RETURNING
      FROM IDAHO&mdash;A WOMAN’S SCALP&mdash;A SCALP DANCE&mdash;SUSPICIOUS
      CIRCUMSTANCE&mdash;ARRIVAL OF BLACKFEET INDIANS&mdash;NEGOTIATIONS FOR MY
      RANSOM&mdash;TREACHERY.</div>
  </div>

  <p><span class="smcap">My</span> last days with the Ogalalla Sioux Indians were destined to be marked
    by a terrible remembrance.</p>

  <p>On the first of October, while the savages lingered in camp about the
    banks of the Yellowstone River, apparently fearing, yet almost inviting
    attack by their near vicinity to the soldiers, a large Mackinaw, or
    flat-boat, was seen coming down the river.</p>

  <p>From their hiding-places in the rocks and bushes, they watched its
    progress with the stealthy ferocity of the tiger waiting for his prey.</p>

  <p>At sundown the unsuspecting travelers pushed their boat toward the
    shore, and landed for the purpose of making a fire and camping for the
    night.</p>

  <p>The party consisted of about twenty persons, men, women, and children.
    Suspecting no danger, they left their arms in the boat.</p>

  <p>With a simultaneous yell, the savages dashed down<span class="pagenum">165</span> upon them, dealing
    death and destruction in rapid strokes.</p>

  <p>The defenseless emigrants made an attempt to rush to the boat for arms,
    but were cut off, and their bleeding bodies dashed into the river as
    fast as they were slain. Then followed the torture of the women and
    children.</p>

  <p>Horrible thought! from which all will turn with sickened soul, and
    shuddering, cry to Heaven, “How long, O Lord! how long shall such
    inhuman atrocities go unpunished?”</p>

  <p>Not a soul was left alive when that black day’s work was done; and the
    unconscious river bore away a warm tide of human blood, and sinking
    human forms.</p>

  <p>When the warriors returned to camp, they brought their frightful
    trophies of blood-stained clothes and ghastly scalps.</p>

  <p>My heart-sick eyes beheld the dreadful fruits of carnage; and, among
    the rest, I saw a woman’s scalp, with heavy chestnut hair, a golden
    brown, and four feet in length, which had been secured for its beauty.
    The tempting treasure lost the poor girl her life, which might have
    been spared; but her glorious locks were needed to hang on the chief’s
    belt.</p>

  <p>Nearly all the flat-boats that passed down the Yellowstone River to the
    Missouri, from the mining regions, during that season, were attacked,
    and in some<span class="pagenum">166</span> instances one or more of the occupants killed. The
    approach of this boat was known, and the Indians had ample time to plan
    their attack so that not a soul should escape.</p>

  <p>That night the whole camp of braves assembled to celebrate the fearful
    scalp dance; and from the door of my tent I witnessed the savage
    spectacle, for I was ill, and, to my great relief, was not forced to
    join in the horrid ceremony.</p>

  <p>A number of squaws occupied the center of the ring they formed, and
    the pitiless wretches held up the fresh scalps that day reaped in the
    harvest of death.</p>

  <p>Around them circled the frantic braves, flourishing torches, and
    brandishing weapons, with the most ferocious barks and yells, and wild
    distortions of countenance.</p>

  <p>Some uttered boasts of bravery and prowess, and others lost their own
    identity in mocking their dying victims in their agony.</p>

  <p>Leaping first on one foot, then on the other, accompanying every
    movement with wild whoops of excitement, they presented a scene never
    to be forgotten.</p>

  <p>The young brave who bore the beautiful locks as his trophy, did not
    join in the dance. He sat alone, looking sad.</p>

  <p>I approached and questioned him, and he replied that he regretted his
    dead victim. He brought a blood-stained dress from his lodge, and told
    me it was<span class="pagenum">167</span> worn by the girl with the lovely hair, whose eyes haunted
    him and made him sorry.</p>

  <p>After being cognizant of this frightful massacre, I shrank more than
    ever from my savage companions, and pursued my tasks in hopeless
    despondence of ever being rescued or restored to civilized life.</p>

  <p>One day I was astonished to notice a strange Indian, whom I had never
    seen before, making signs to me of a mysterious nature.</p>

  <p>He indicated by signs that he wanted me to run away with him to the
    white people. I had become so suspicious, from having been deceived so
    many times, that I turned from him and entered the chief’s tent, where,
    despite his cruelty and harshness to me, I felt comparatively safe.</p>

  <p>I afterward saw this Indian, or rather white man, or half-breed, as I
    believe him to have been, though he could not, or would not speak a
    word of English. His long hair hung loosely about his shoulders, and
    was of a dark brown color. He had in no respect the appearance of an
    Indian, but rather that of a wild, reckless frontier desperado. I had
    never seen him before, though he seemed well known in the camp.</p>

  <p>One thing that perhaps made me more suspicious and afraid to trust any
    one, was a knowledge of the fact that many of the Indians who had lost
    relatives in the recent battles with General Sully, were thirsting for
    my blood, and would have been glad to decoy me<span class="pagenum">168</span> far enough away to
    wreak their vengeance, and be safe from the fury of the old chief, my
    task-master.</p>

  <p>This stranger came one day into a tent where I was, and showed me a
    small pocket bible that had belonged to my husband, and was presented
    to him by his now sainted mother many years before. His object was to
    assure me that I might trust him; but such an instinctive horror of the
    man had taken possession of me that I refused to believe him; and at
    last he became enraged and threatened to kill me if I would not go with
    him.</p>

  <p>I plead with him to give me the bible, but he refused. How dear it
    would have been to me from association, and what strength and comfort
    I would have received from its precious promises, shut out, as I was,
    from my world and all religious privileges and surrounded by heathen
    savages.</p>

  <p>Soon after the foregoing incident, the old chief and his three sisters
    went away on a journey, and I was sent to live with some of his
    relatives, accompanied by my little companion, Yellow Bird. We traveled
    all day to reach our destination, a small Indian village. The family
    I was to live with until the return of the chief and his sisters,
    consisted of a very old Indian and his squaw, and a young girl.</p>

  <p>I had a dread of going among strangers, but was thankful for the
    kindness with which I was received by this old couple. I was very
    tired, and so sad and<span class="pagenum">169</span> depressed, that I cared not to ask for
    any thing, but the old squaw, seeming to understand my feelings,
    considerately placed before me meat and water, and kindly ministered to
    my wants in every way their means would allow.</p>

  <p>I was with this family nearly three weeks, and was treated with almost
    affectionate kindness, not only by them, but by every member of the
    little community. The children would come to see me, and manifest in
    various ways their interest in me. They would say, “Wasechawea (white
    woman) looks sad; I want to shake hands with her.”</p>

  <p>I soon began to adapt myself to my new surroundings, and became more
    happy and contented than I had ever yet been since my captivity began.
    My time was occupied in assisting the motherly old squaw in her sewing
    and other domestic work.</p>

  <p>There was but once a cloud come between us. The old chief had given
    orders that I was not to be permitted to go out among the other
    villagers alone, orders of which I knew nothing. Feeling a new sense
    of freedom, I had sometimes gone out, and on one occasion, having been
    invited into different tipis by the squaws, staid so long that the old
    Indian sent for me, and seemed angry when I returned. He said it was
    good for me to stay in his tent, but bad to go out among the others. I
    pacified him at last by saying I knew his home was pleasant, and I was
    happy there,<span class="pagenum">170</span> and that I did not know it was bad to go among the other
    tents.</p>

  <p>The old chief returned, finally, and my brief season of enjoyment
    ended. He seemed to delight in torturing me, often pinching my arms
    until they were black and blue. Regarding me as the cause of his
    wounded arm, he was determined that I should suffer with him.</p>

  <p>While in this village “Man-Afraid-of-His-Horses” arrived, and I was
    made aware of his high standing as a chief and warrior by the feasting
    and dancing which followed. He was splendidly mounted and equipped, as
    also was another Indian who accompanied him.</p>

  <p>I have since learned from my husband that the treacherous chief made
    such statements of his influence with the hostile Indians as to induce
    him to purchase for them both an expensive outfit, in the hope of my
    release. I saw and conversed with him several times, and though he told
    me that he was from the Platte, he said nothing of the real errand on
    which he was sent, but returned to the fort and reported to Mr. Kelly
    that the band had moved and I could not be found.</p>

  <p>Captain Fisk had made known to General Sully the fact of my being among
    the Indians, and the efforts he had made for my release; and when the
    Blackfeet presented themselves before the General, asking for peace,
    and avowing their weariness of hostility, <span class="pagenum">171</span>anxious to purchase arms,
    ammunition, and necessaries for the approaching winter, he replied:</p>

  <p>“I want no peace with you. You hold in captivity a white woman; deliver
    her up to us, and we will believe in your professions. But unless you
    do, we will raise an army of soldiers as numerous as the trees on the
    Missouri River and exterminate the Indians.”</p>

  <p>The Blackfeet assured General Sully that they held no white woman in
    their possession, but that I was among the Ogalallas.</p>

  <p>“As you are friendly with them,” said the General, “go to them and
    secure her, and we will then reward you for so doing.”</p>

  <p>The Blackfeet warriors appeared openly in the village a few days
    afterward, and declared their intentions, stating in council the
    determination of General Sully.</p>

  <p>The Ogalallas were not afraid, they said, and refused to let me go.
    They held solemn council for two days, and at last resolved that the
    Blackfeet should take me as a ruse, to enable them to enter the fort,
    and a wholesale slaughter should exterminate the soldiers.</p>

  <p>While thus deliberating as to what they thought best&mdash;part of them
    willing, the other half refusing to let me go&mdash;Hunkiapa, a warrior,
    came into the lodge, and ordered me out, immediately following me.</p>

  <p>He then led me into a lodge where there were fifty warriors, painted
    and armed&mdash;their bows strung and their quivers full of arrows.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">172</span></p>

  <p>From thence, the whole party, including three squaws, who, noting my
    extreme fear, accompanied me, started toward a creek, where there were
    five horses and warriors to attend us to the Blackfeet village.</p>

  <p>Placing me on a horse, we were rapidly pursuing our way, when a party
    of the Ogalallas, who were unwilling, came up with us, to reclaim me.</p>

  <p>Here they parleyed for a time, and, finally, after a solemn promise on
    the part of my new captors that I should be returned safely, and that I
    should be cared for and kindly treated, we were allowed to proceed.</p>

  <p>In their parleying, one of the warriors ordered me to alight from
    the horse, pointing a pistol to my breast. Many of them clamored for
    my life, but, finally, they settled the matter, and permitted us to
    proceed on our journey.</p>

  <p>After so many escapes from death, this last seemed miraculous; but God
    willed it otherwise, and to him I owe my grateful homage.</p>

  <p>It was a bitter trial for me to be obliged to go with this new and
    stranger tribe. I was unwilling to exchange my life for an unknown one,
    and especially as my companionship with the sisters of the chief had
    been such as to protect me from injury or insult. A sort of security
    and safety was felt in the lodge of the chief, which now the fear of my
    new position made me appreciate still more.</p>

  <p>Savages they were, and I had longed to be free<span class="pagenum">173</span> from them; but now I
    parted with them with regret and misgiving.</p>

  <p>Though my new masters, for such I considered them, held out promise of
    liberty and restoration to my friends, knowing the treacherous nature
    of the Indians, I doubted them. True, the Ogalallas had treated me at
    times with great harshness and cruelty, yet I had never suffered from
    any of them the slightest personal or unchaste insult. Let me bear
    testimony to this redeeming feature in their treatment of me.</p>

  <p>At the time of my capture I became the exclusive property of Ottawa,
    the head chief, a man over seventy-five years of age, and partially
    blind, yet whose power over the band was absolute. Receiving a severe
    wound in a melee I have already given an account of, I was compelled
    to become his nurse or medicine woman; and my services as such were so
    appreciated, that harsh and cruel as he might be, it was dangerous for
    others to offer me insult or injury; and to this fact, doubtless, I owe
    my escape from a fate worse than death.</p>

  <p>The Blackfeet are a band of the Sioux nation; consequently, are allies
    in battle. The chief dared not refuse on this account; besides, he was
    an invalid, and wounded badly.</p>

  <p>The Blackfeet left three of their best horses as a guarantee for my
    safe return.</p>

  <p>The chief of the Ogalallas had expressed the desire<span class="pagenum">174</span> that, if the Great
    Spirit should summon him away, that I might be killed, in order to
    become his attendant to the spirit land.</p>

  <p>It was now the commencement of November, and their way seemed to lead
    to the snowy regions, where the cold might prove unendurable.</p>

  <p>When I heard the pledge given by the Blackfeet, my fears abated; hope
    sprang buoyant at the thought of again being within the reach of my own
    people, and I felt confident that, once in the fort, I could frustrate
    their plans by warning the officers of their intentions.</p>

  <p>I knew what the courage and discipline of fort soldiers could
    accomplish, and so hoped, not only to thwart the savage treachery, but
    punish the instigators.</p>

  </div>

  <p><span class="smcap">During</span> my forced sojourn with the Ogalallas, I had abundant opportunity
    to observe the manners and customs peculiar to a race of people living
    so near, and yet of whom so little is known by the general reader. A
    chapter devoted to this subject will doubtless interest all who read
    this narrative.</p>

  <p>Nothing can be more simple in its arrangement than an Indian camp when
    journeying, and especially when on the war path. The camping ground,
    when practicable, is near a stream of water, and adjacent to timber.
    After reaching the spot selected, the ponies are unloaded by the
    squaws, and turned loose to graze. The tents, or “tipis,” are put up,
    and wood and water brought for cooking purposes. All drudgery of this
    kind is performed by the squaws, an Indian brave scorning as degrading
    all kinds of labor not incident to the chase or the war path.</p>

  <p>An Indian tipi is composed of several dressed skins, usually of the
    buffalo, sewed together and stretched over a number of poles, the
    larger ones containing as<span class="pagenum">176</span> many as twenty of these poles, which are
    fifteen to twenty feet long. They are of yellow pine, stripped of
    bark, and are used as “travois” in traveling. Three poles are tied
    together near the top or small ends, and raised to an upright position,
    the bottoms being spread out as far as the fastening at the top will
    permit. Other poles are laid into the crotch thus formed at the top,
    and spread out in a circular line with the three first put up. This
    comprises the frame work, and when in the position described is ready
    to receive the covering, which is raised to the top by means of a
    rawhide rope, when, a squaw seizing each lower corner, it is rapidly
    brought around, and the edges fastened together with wooden pins, a
    squaw getting down on all fours, forming a perch upon which the tallest
    squaw of the family mounts and inserts the pins as high as she can
    reach. A square opening in the tent serves for a door, and is entered
    in a stooping posture. A piece of hide hangs loosely over this opening,
    and is kept in position by a heavy piece of wood fastened at the bottom.</p>

  <p>When in position, the Indian tipi is of the same shape as the Sibley
    tent. In the middle is built a fire, where all the cooking is done, a
    hole at the top affording egress for the smoke. The preparation for a
    meal is a very simple affair. Meat was almost their only article of
    diet, and was generally roasted, or rather warmed through over the
    fire, though sometimes it was<span class="pagenum">177</span> partially boiled, and always eaten
    without salt or bread. They have no set time for eating; will fast all
    of one day, and perhaps eat a dozen times the next.</p>

  <p>The outer edge of the tent contains the beds of the family, which are
    composed of buffalo robes and blankets. These are snugly rolled up
    during the day, and do service as seats.</p>

  <p>If there is reason to suppose an enemy near, no fire is allowed in the
    camp; and in that case each one satisfies appetite as best he or she
    can, but generally with “pa-pa,” or dried buffalo meat.</p>

  <p>An Indian camp at close of day presents a most animated picture. The
    squaws passing to and fro, loaded with wood and water, or meat, or
    guiding the sledges drawn by dogs, carrying their all; dusky warriors
    squatted on the ground, in groups, around fires built in the open
    air, smoking their pipes, or repairing weapons, and recounting their
    exploits; half naked and naked children capering about in childish
    glee, furnish a picture of the nomadic life of these Indians of strange
    interest. Not more than ten minutes are required to set up an Indian
    village.</p>

  <p>When it becomes necessary to move a village, which fact is never known
    to the people, a crier goes through the camp, shouting, “Egalakapo!
    Egalakapo!” when all the squaws drop whatever work they may be engaged
    in, and in an instant are busy as bees, taking down tipis, bringing
    in the ponies and dogs, and loading <span class="pagenum">178</span>them; and in less than fifteen
    minutes the cavalcade is on the march.</p>

  <p>The squaws accompany the men when they go to hunt buffalo, and as fast
    as the animals are killed, they strip off their hides, and then cut off
    the meat in strips about three feet long, three to four inches wide,
    and two inches thick; and such is their skill that the bones will be
    left intact and as free from meat as though they had been boiled. The
    meat is then taken to camp and hung up to dry. It is most filthy, being
    covered with grass and the excrement of the buffalo.</p>

  <p>The medicine men treat all diseases nearly alike. The principal efforts
    are directed to expelling the spirit, whatever it may be, which it is
    expected the medicine man will soon discover, and having informed the
    friends what it is, he usually requires them to be in readiness to
    shoot it, as soon as he shall succeed in expelling it.</p>

  <p>Incantations and ceremonies are used, intended to secure the aid of
    the spirit, or spirits, the Indian worships. When he thinks he has
    succeeded, the medicine man gives the command, and from two to six or
    more guns are fired at the door of the tent to destroy the spirit as it
    passes out.</p>

  <p>Many of these medicine men depend wholly on conjuring, sitting by the
    bedside of the patient, making gestures and frightful noises, shaking
    rattles, and endeavoring, by all means in their power, to frighten
    the evil spirit. They use fumigation, and are very fond<span class="pagenum">179</span> of aromatic
    substances, using and burning cedar and many different plants to
    cleanse the tent in which the sick person lies.</p>

  <p>The native plants, roots, herbs, and so forth, are used freely, and are
    efficacious.</p>

  <p>They are very careful to conceal from each other, except a few
    initiated, as well as from white men, a knowledge of the plants used
    as medicine, probably believing that their efficacy, in some measure,
    depends on this concealment.</p>

  <p>There is a tall, branching plant, growing abundantly in the open woods
    and prairies near the Missouri River, which is used chiefly by the
    Indians as a purgative, and is <i>euphorbia corrallata</i>, well known to
    the botanist.</p>

  <p>Medicines are generally kept in bags made of the skin of some animal.</p>

  <p>All the drinks which are given the sick to quench thirst are
    astringent, sometimes bitter and sometimes slightly mucilaginous.</p>

  <p>The most common is called red-root (<i>ceanothus canadensis</i>), a plant
    abounding in the western prairies, although they seem to have more
    faith in some ceremony.</p>

  <p>A dance peculiar to the tribe where I was, called the pipe dance, is
    worth mentioning, and is called by the Indians a good medicine. A small
    fire is kindled in the village, and around this the dancers, which
    usually consist of young men, collect, each one seated upon a robe.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">180</span></p>

  <p>The presiding genius is a chief, or a medicine man, who seats himself
    by a fire, with a long pipe which he prepares for smoking. Offering it
    first to the Great Spirit, he then extends it toward the north, south,
    east, and west, muttering unintelligibly. Meanwhile an equally august
    personage beats a drum, singing and leaping and smoking. The master
    of ceremonies sits calmly looking on, puffing away with all the vigor
    imaginable.</p>

  <p>The dance closes with piercing yells, and barking like frightened dogs,
    and it lasts an hour or more.</p>

  <p>When the mother gives birth to her child, it is not uncommon for no
    other person to be present. She then lives in a hut or lodge by herself
    until the child is twenty-five or thirty days old, when she takes it to
    its father, who then sees his child for the first time.</p>

  <p>Females, after parturition, and also in other conditions, bathe
    themselves&mdash;swim, as they express it&mdash;in the nearest river or lake.</p>

  <p>This is, no doubt, a most efficacious means of imparting strength and
    vigor to the constitution, and it is certain that Indian females are
    less subject to what are termed female complaints than white women.</p>

  <p>It is an uncommon occurrence that an Indian woman loses her life in
    parturition.</p>

  <p>When the child is old enough to run alone, it is relieved of its
    swathings, and if the weather is not too cold, it is sent off without a
    particle of clothing to protect <span class="pagenum">181</span>it or impede the action of its limbs,
    and in this manner it is allowed to remain until it is several years
    old, when it receives a limited wardrobe.</p>

  <p>Despite the rugged and exposed life they lead, there are comparatively
    few cripples and deformed persons among them. It is said that deformed
    infants are regarded as unprofitable and a curse from the Great Spirit,
    and disposed of by death soon after birth. Sometimes, at the death
    of a mother, the infant is also interred. An incident of this kind
    was related to me. A whole family had been carried off by small-pox
    except an infant. Those who were not sick had as much to do as they
    could conveniently attend to, consequently there was no one willing
    to take charge of the little orphan. It was placed in the arms of its
    dead mother, enveloped in blankets and a buffalo-robe, and laid upon a
    scaffold in their burying-place. Its cries were heard for some time,
    but at last they grew fainter, and finally were hushed altogether in
    the cold embrace of death, with the moaning wind sounding its requiem,
    and the wolves howling in the surrounding gloom, a fitting dirge for so
    sad a fate.</p>

  <p>The Indians believe that God, or the Great Spirit, created the universe
    and all things just as they exist.</p>

  <p>They believe the sun to be a large body of heat, and that it revolves
    around the earth. Some believe it is a ball of fire. They do not
    comprehend the revolution of the earth around the sun. They suppose
    the sun<span class="pagenum">182</span> literally rises and sets, and that our present theory is an
    invention of the white man, and that he is not sincere when he says the
    earth moves around the sun.</p>

  <p>They say that paradise, or the happy hunting-grounds, is above, but
    where, they have no definite idea, though all think the future a
    happier state. They regard skill in hunting or success in war as the
    passport to eternal happiness and plenty, where there is no cold or
    wet season. Still they all acknowledge it is the gift of the “Wa-hon
    Tonka,” the Great Spirit.</p>

  <p>The manner of disposing of their dead is one of the peculiar customs
    of the Indians of the plains which impresses the beholder for the
    first time most forcibly. Four forked posts are set up, and on them
    a platform is laid, high enough to be out of reach of wolves or
    other carnivorous animals, and on this the body is placed, wrapped
    in buffalo-robes or blankets, and sometimes both, according to the
    circumstances of the deceased, and these are wound securely with a
    strip of buffalo hide. If in the vicinity of timber, the body is
    placed on a platform, securely fixed in the crotch of a high tree. The
    wrappings of buffalo-robe or blankets protect the body from ravenous
    birds that hover around, attracted by the scent of an anticipated feast.</p>

  <p>All that pertained to the dead while living, in the way of furs,
    blankets, weapons, cooking utensils, etc., are also deposited with the
    body. In some instances, the horse belonging to the deceased is shot.
    They believe <span class="pagenum">183</span>that the spirit wanders off to distant hunting-grounds,
    and as it may have to pass over a country where there is no game, a
    quantity of dried buffalo meat is usually left with the body for its
    subsistence. While on a journey, these burial places are held sacred
    as those of a Christian nation, and when a tribe is passing such
    localities they will make a detour rather than go the more direct road
    by the resting-place of their dead, while the relatives leave the trail
    and go alone to the spot, and there renew and repeat their mourning as
    on the occasion of his death. They also leave presents for the dead of
    such little trinkets as he most prized before he departed to his new
    hunting-grounds.</p>

  <p>The boys are early taught the arts of war. A bow and arrows are among
    the first presents that an Indian youth receives from his parents,
    and he is soon instructed in their use. Indeed, the skill of a hunter
    seems to be a natural endowment, and, although some are more accurate
    and active than others, they all shoot with wonderful precision and
    surprising aptitude, seeming to inherit a passionate love for the
    sports of the chase.</p>

  <p>The Indian boy receives no name until some distinguishing trait of
    character or feat suggests one, and changes it from time to time as
    more fitting ones are suggested. Some of their names are very odd, and
    some quite vulgar.</p>

  <p>The wife is sometimes wooed and won, as if there<span class="pagenum">184</span> was something of
    sentiment in the Indian character, but oftener purchased without the
    wooing. When the desired object is particularly attractive, and of a
    good family, the courting and purchasing both may be required. When
    a young brave goes courting, he decorates himself out in his best
    attire, instinctively divining that appearances weigh much in the eyes
    of a forest belle, or dusky maiden, who receives him bashfully, for a
    certain kind of modesty is inherent in Indian girls, which is rather
    incongruous when considered in connection with their peculiar mode of
    life. Discretion and propriety are carefully observed, and the lovers
    sit side by side in silence, he occasionally producing presents for
    her acceptance. These express a variety of sentiment, and refer to
    distinct and separate things; some signifying love; some, strength;
    some, bravery; others allude to the life of servitude she is expected
    to live if she becomes his wife. If they are accepted graciously, and
    the maiden remains seated, it is considered equivalent to an assurance
    of love on her part, and is acted upon accordingly. Although no woman’s
    life is made less slavish by the marriage connection, and no one is
    treated with respect, it is scarcely known in Indian life that a girl
    has remained unmarried even to middle age.</p>

  <p>When a chief desires to multiply the number of his wives, he often
    marries several sisters, if they can be had, not because of any
    particular fancy he may have<span class="pagenum">185</span> for any but the one who first captivated
    him, but because he thinks it more likely to have harmony in the
    household when they are all of one family. Not even squaws can live
    happily together, when each may have a part interest in the same man
    as their husband jointly. Polygamy is inconsistent with the female
    character, whether in barbarism or civilization.</p>

  <p>As many skins as they can transport on their ponies, of the game killed
    while on their hunts, are dressed by the squaws, and then taken to
    some trading post, military station, or agency, and bartered off for
    such articles as are most desired by them, such as beads, paints,
    etc., and powder, lead, and caps. They are willing to allow much more
    proportionately for ammunition than any other articles. They are most
    outrageously swindled by the traders whom our Government licenses to
    trade with them. A buffalo-robe which the trader sells for from ten to
    fifteen dollars, is bought from the Indians for a pint cup of sugar and
    a small handful of bullets, while furs of all kinds are exchanged for
    paints and trinkets at equally disproportionate rates. The Indians know
    they are cheated whenever they barter with the white traders, but they
    have no remedy, as there is no competition, and hence much of their
    disaffection.</p>

  <p>Buffalo-robes, bearskins, and deer, and antelope skins are brought in
    in great numbers; they shoot and trap the beaver and otter expressly
    for their furs.</p>

  <p>The Indians are almost universally fond of whisky,<span class="pagenum">186</span> and have a strong
    propensity for gambling. They will risk at cards almost every thing
    they own, and if unsuccessful appear quite resigned to their loss,
    resting in the gambler’s hope of “better luck next time.”</p>

  <p>The squaws play a game with small bones of oblong shape, which seems to
    have a great fascination for them, as I have known them to spend whole
    days and nights at it, and in many instances gambling away every thing
    they owned. Five of these pieces are used, each possessing a relative
    value in the game, designated by spots from one to five on one side,
    the other being blank. They are placed in a dish or small basket, which
    is shaken and then struck upon the ground with a jar, tossing the
    pieces over, and according to the number of spots up, so is the game
    decided, very similar, I imagine, to the white man’s game of “high-die.”</p>

  <p>They have a peculiar way of defining time. When they wish to designate
    an hour of the day, they point to the position the sun should be in
    at that time. The number of days is the number of sleeps. Their next
    division of time is the number of moons, instead of our months; and the
    seasons are indicated by the state of vegetation. For instance, spring
    is when the grass begins to grow, and the autumn when the leaves fall
    from the trees, while years are indicated by the season of snows.</p>

  <p>There is a language of signs common to all the tribes,<span class="pagenum">187</span> by which one
    tribe may communicate with another without being able to speak or
    understand its dialect. Each tribe is known by some particular sign.</p>

  <p>The Indian is noted for his power of endurance of both fatigue and
    physical pain. I have thought much upon the fear manifested by these
    reputed brave barbarians; they seem to be borne down with the most
    tormenting fear for their personal safety at all times, at home or
    roaming for plunder, or when hunting, and yet courage is made a virtue
    among them, while cowardice is the unpardonable sin. When compelled to
    meet death, they seem to muster sullen, obstinate defiance of their
    doom, that makes the most of a dreaded necessity, rather than seek a
    preparation to meet it with submission, which they often dissemble, but
    never possess.</p>

  <p>Instinct, more than reason, is the guide of the red man. He repudiates
    improvement, and despises manual effort. For ages has his heart been
    imbedded in moral pollution.</p>

  <p>The blanket, as worn by the Indian, is an insuperable barrier to his
    advance in arts or agriculture. When this is forever dispensed with,
    then his hands will be free to grasp the mechanic’s tools or guide the
    plow. It is both graceful and chaste in their eyes, and to adopt the
    white man’s dress is a great obstacle, a requirement too humiliating,
    for they have personal as well as national pride. No hat is worn, but
    the head<span class="pagenum">188</span> is covered with feathers and rude ornaments. A heavy mass of
    wampum, often very expensive, adorns the neck. Frequently the entire
    rim of each ear is pierced with holes, and adorned with jewels of
    silver, or something resembling it.</p>

  <p>The Indian does every thing through motives of policy. He has none
    of the kindlier feelings of humanity in him. He is as devoid of
    gratitude as he is hypocritical and treacherous. He observes a treaty,
    or promise, only so long as it is dangerous for him to disregard it,
    or for his interest, in other ways, to keep it. Cruelty is inherent
    in them, and is early manifested in the young, torturing birds,
    turtles, or any little animal that may fall into their hands. They
    seem to delight in it, while the pleasure of the adult in torturing
    his prisoners is most unquestionable. They are inveterate beggars, but
    never give, unless with a view to receive a more valuable present in
    return.</p>

  <p>The white man, he has been taught, is his enemy, and he has become the
    most implacable enemy of the white man. His most fiendish murders of
    the innocent is his sweetest revenge for a wrong that has been done by
    another.</p>

  <p>The youth are very fond of war. They have no other ambition, and
    pant for the glory of battle, longing for the notes of the war song,
    that they may rush in and win the feathers of a brave. They listen
    to the stories of the old men, as they recall the stirring scenes<span class="pagenum">189</span>
    of their youth, or sing their war songs, which form only a boasting
    recapitulation of their daring and bravery. They yearn for the glory
    of war, which is the only path to distinction. Having no arts or
    industrial pursuits, the tribes are fast waning from war, exposure, and
    disease.</p>

  <p>But few of the tribes cultivate the soil, the nature of the Indian
    rendering in his eyes as degrading all labor not incident to the chase
    or the war-path; and notwithstanding the efforts of missionaries,
    and the vast sums of money expended by the Government to place them
    on reservations and teach them the art of agriculture, the attempts
    to civilize the Indian in that way may be considered almost a total
    failure. The results bear no comparison to their cost.</p>

  <p>Their ideas of the extent and power of the white race are very limited,
    and after I had learned the language sufficiently to converse with
    them, I frequently tried to explain to them the superior advantages
    of the white man’s mode of living. They would ask me many questions,
    as to the number of the white men on this side of the big water, and
    how far that extended; and on being told of two big oceans, they would
    ask if the whites owned the big country on the other side, and if
    there were any Indians there. Many of my statements were received with
    incredulity, and I was often called a liar, especially when I told of
    the number and rapid increase of the white race; sometimes <span class="pagenum">190</span>the older
    ones would get angry. The younger ones were often eager listeners, and
    especially in times of scarcity and hunger would they gather around me
    to learn about the white man, and then would I endeavor to impress them
    with the advantages of a fixed home and tilling the soil over their
    wild, roaming life.</p>

      TO PURCHASE ME INDIGNANTLY REJECTED&mdash;A YANKTON ATTEMPTS MY CAPTURE.</div>
  </div>

  <p><span class="smcap">The</span> Blackfeet village was one hundred and fifty miles from the
    Ogalallas, and the way thither lay often over the tops of bare and
    sandy hills.</p>

  <p>On the summits of these heights I found shells such as are picked up
    at the sea-side. The Indians accounted for their appearance there by
    saying, that once a great sea rolled over the face of the country, and
    only one man in a boat escaped with his family. He had sailed about in
    the boat until the waters retired to their place, and, living there,
    became the father of all the Indians.</p>

  <p>These savages proved very kind to me. Though their nation is regarded
    by the whites as very vindictive and hostile, they showed me nothing
    but civility and respect.</p>

  <p>On the third morning we reached a small village, where we halted.
    The Indians of the village were rejoiced to see me. Among them I
    recognized many<span class="pagenum">192</span> familiar faces, and they imparted to us their mistrust
    and apprehension lest I had been stolen from the Ogalallas; but the
    Blackfeet assured them to the contrary; and, after questioning me, they
    became satisfied, and gave us food, promising to send warriors to our
    village, and giving us another horse.</p>

  <p>The journey to the village of the Blackfeet was exceedingly
    wearisome&mdash;completely exhausting me by its length; and I suffered from
    the intense cold weather.</p>

  <p>Approaching their village, they entered it with loud demonstrations of
    joy, singing and whooping after the manner of their race, with noises
    defying description.</p>

  <p>I was received with great joy; and even marks of distinction were shown
    me. That night there was a feast, and every thing denoted a time of
    rejoicing.</p>

  <p>My life was now changed&mdash;instead of waiting upon others, they waited
    upon me.</p>

  <p>The day of my arrival in the Blackfeet village was a sad one, indeed,
    being the first anniversary of my wedding. The songs and shouts of
    exultation of the Indians seemed like a bitter mockery of my misery and
    helplessness.</p>

  <p>I met in the village many warriors whom I had seen during the summer,
    and knew that they had participated in the battles with General Sully.
    They saw that something had made me sad and thoughtful, and asked what
    it was. I told them it was my birth-day.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">193</span></p>

  <p>Soon after my arrival, Egosegalonicha was sent to me, and inquired how
    I was treated, and particularly wished to know if they were respectful
    to me. She told me that she was sent to inquire for my safety and
    well-being, and that any remissness on the part of the Blackfeet would
    be visited with vengeance.</p>

  <p>She told me that her people mourned the captive’s absence, and grieved
    for her presence. From others I learned the same.</p>

  <p>Next morning there was great commotion in the camp, caused by the
    arrival of a delegation from the Yanktons, with a handsome horse and
    saddle, as a present for me.</p>

  <p>The saddle was of exquisite workmanship, embroidered with beads, and
    richly decorated with fringe.</p>

  <p>The Yanktons desired to purchase me, offering five of their finest
    horses for me, which the Blackfeet were quite indignant at, replying,
    that they also had fine horses; and, deeming it an insult, returned the
    horse and its saddle. Fearing my disappointment, they, in council that
    night, decided to present me with something as worthy as the Yanktons
    had sent.</p>

  <p>Accordingly, at the door of the tent next morning were four of their
    best animals; eight beautiful robes were brought in by the young men,
    and given me also.</p>

  <p>The Yanktons were told to return to their tribe, and if such a message
    was again sent, the hatchet would be painted and given to them.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">194</span></p>

  <p>This closed the negotiation, but not their efforts to obtain me.</p>

  <p>The large reward which had been offered for my recovery caused the
    Indians much trouble, as frequently large parties from other tribes
    would come in, offering to purchase me from those who held me captive.
    Several such instances occurred while I was with the Ogalallas; nor
    were the Blackfeet exempt from similar annoyances.</p>

  <p>One day, while in Tall Soldier’s tipi, there was a large body of
    mounted warriors seen approaching the village. The women gathered
    around me, and told me I must stay in the tent, concealed. All
    was excitement, and the women seemed frightened. Soon I knew that
    preparations were being made for a feast on a large scale. The strange
    warriors came into camp and held a council, at which Tall Soldier made
    a speech, which, from the distance, I could not understand; they then
    had a feast, and departed. The Blackfeet gave me to understand that
    the visit of these Indians was on my account, as had been that of the
    Yanktons.</p>

  <p>Soon after, I noticed that parties of warriors would leave the camp
    daily and return, bringing ammunition and goods of various kinds. I
    learned from the squaws and children that a party of traders from the
    Platte River had arrived in the neighborhood with four wagons, to trade
    with the Indians, and that they<span class="pagenum">195</span> wanted to buy me, but that the Indians
    would not part with me. I pretended to the Indians that I did not
    desire to leave them, but plead that I might go with them to see the
    white men, which was refused, as was also a request that I might write
    a letter to them.</p>

  <p>Soon after, the traders were murdered, only one man escaping, who
    reached Fort Laramie nearly dead from hunger and exposure, having
    traveled the whole distance from the Missouri River on foot.</p>

  <p>I have since learned that the men were sent out by Mr. Beauve, a
    trader, near Fort Laramie, with instructions to procure my release if
    it required all they possessed.</p>

  <p>Since learning these facts, I am more than ever convinced that the
    reluctance of the Indians to give me up grew out of their hope of
    capturing Fort Sully through my involuntary agency, and securing a
    greater booty than any ransom offered; as also of obtaining revenge for
    the losses inflicted upon their nation by the soldiers under General
    Sully.</p>

  <p>The Blackfeet appeared in every respect superior to the tribe I had
    left. The chief, “Tall Soldier,” displayed the manners and bearing of a
    natural gentleman.</p>

  <p>They kept up an air of friendliness, and communicated frequently with
    the whites; but, in reality, were ready to join any hostile expedition
    against them, and<span class="pagenum">196</span> were with the Ogalalla Sioux when our train was
    attacked at Box Elder.</p>

  <p>The Blackfeet seemed to be stationary in their village, only sallying
    out in small parties for plunder and horses; and, during that time,
    keeping up a succession of entertainments at the tipi of the chief,
    where a constant arrival of warriors and many Indians from other
    tribes, who were warmly welcomed, added to the excitement of the days.</p>

  <p>I sympathized with the poor wife of the chief, who was the only woman,
    beside myself, in the tent, and to whose labor all the feasts were due.</p>

  <p>She was obliged to dress the meat, make fires, carry water, and wait
    upon strangers, besides setting the lodge in order.</p>

  <p>These unceasing toils she performed alone&mdash;the commands of the chief
    forbidding me to aid her.</p>

  <p>While with the Ogalallas, I had never crossed their will or offered
    resistance to my tasks, however heavy, having learned that obedience
    and cheerful industry were greatly prized; and it was, doubtless, my
    conciliating policy that had at last won the Indians, and made them
    bewail my loss so deeply.</p>

  <p>The squaws are very rebellious, often displaying ungovernable and
    violent temper. They consider their life a servitude, and being beaten
    at times like animals, and receiving no sort of sympathy, it acts upon
    them accordingly.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">197</span></p>

  <p>The contrast between them and my patient submission had its effect
    upon the Indians, and caused them to miss me when separated from them.</p>

  <p>During my sojourn in this village I received invitations to every
    feast, and to the different lodges. One day, when visiting one of these
    lodges, a package of letters was given me to read. They had been taken
    from Captain Fisk’s train, and were touchingly beautiful. Some of them
    were the correspondence of a Mr. Nichols with a young lady, to whom he
    seemed tenderly attached. I was asked to read these letters and explain
    them to the Indians.</p>

  <p>I was removed at different times to various lodges, as a sort of
    concealment, as I learned that the Yanktons had not yet given up the
    idea of securing me; and, one night, I awoke from my slumbers to behold
    an Indian bending over me, cutting through the robes which covered me,
    after making a great incision in the tent, whereby he entered. Fearing
    to move, I reached out my hand to the squaw who slept near me (whose
    name was Chahompa Sea&mdash;White Sugar), pinching her, to arouse her, which
    had its effect; for she immediately arose and gave the alarm, at which
    the Indian fled. This caused great excitement in the camp, and many
    threats were made against the Yanktons.</p>

  <p>The intense cold and furious storms that followed my arrival among the
    Blackfeet precluded the possibility <span class="pagenum">198</span>of their setting out immediately
    on the proposed journey to Fort Sully.</p>

  <p>The snow-drifts had rendered the mountain passes impassable, and the
    chief informed me that they must wait until they were free from danger,
    before taking leave of the shelter and security of their protected
    village.</p>

      FALLEN?”&mdash;ARRIVAL AT THE FORT&mdash;I AM FREE!</div>
  </div>

  <p>“<span class="smcap">Jumping Bear</span>,” who rescued me from the revengeful arrow of the Indian
    whose horse the chief shot, one day presented himself to me, and
    reminded me of my indebtedness to him in thus preserving my life.</p>

  <p>Trembling with fear, I listened to his avowal of more than ordinary
    feeling, during which he assured me that I had no cause to fear
    him&mdash;that he had always liked the white woman, and would be more than a
    friend to me.</p>

  <p>I replied, that I did not fear him; that I felt grateful to him for his
    kindness and protection, but that unless he proved his friendship for
    me, no persuasion could induce me to listen.</p>

  <p>“Will you carry a letter to my people at the fort, delivering it into
    the hands of the great chief there? They will reward you for your
    kindness to their sister;<span class="pagenum">200</span> they will give you many presents, and you
    will return rich.”</p>

  <p>“I dare not go,” he replied. “Nor could I get back before the warriors
    came to our village.”</p>

  <p>“My people will give you a fast horse,” said I, “and you may return
    speedily. Go now, and prove your friendship by taking the letter, and
    returning with your prizes.”</p>

  <p>I assured him that the letter contained nothing that would harm him or
    his people; that I had written of him and of his kindness, and of his
    good will toward them. After many and long interviews, the women of
    the lodge using their influence, I at last prevailed upon him to go,
    and invoking the bright moon as a witness to my pledge of honor and
    truth, he started on his journey, bearing the letter, which I believed
    was to seal my fate for weal or woe. In the moonlight I watched his
    retreating form, imploring Heaven to grant the safe delivery of the
    little messenger, upon which so much depended.</p>

  <p>Daring and venturesome deed! Should he prove false to me, and allow any
    one outside the fort to see the letter, my doom was inevitable.</p>

  <p>Many days of intense anxiety were passed after his departure. The
    squaws, fearing that I had done wrong in sending him, were continually
    asking questions, and it was with difficulty I could allay their<span class="pagenum">201</span>
    anxiety, and prevent them from disclosing the secret to the other women.</p>

  <p>The contents of the letter were a warning to the “Big Chief” and the
    soldiers of an intended attack on the fort and the massacre of the
    garrison, using me as a ruse to enable them to get inside the fort; and
    beseeching them to rescue me if possible.</p>

  <p>The messenger reached the fort, and was received by the officer of the
    day, Lieutenant Hesselberger, and conducted to the commander of the
    post, Major House, and Adjutant Pell, who had been left there to treat
    with the Indians on my account.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

  <div class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a>
     A written statement from Lieutenant Hesselberger, setting
    forth the fact of my writing and sending the letter of warning, and
    that it undoubtedly was the means of saving the garrison at Fort Sully
    from massacre, is on file in the Treasury Department at Washington. A
    certified copy is published in connection with this narrative.
  </div>

  <p>General Sully was absent at Washington, but every necessary precaution
    was taken to secure the fort.</p>

  <p>Jumping Bear received a suit of clothes and some presents, and was sent
    back with a letter for me, which I never received, as I never saw him
    again. These facts I learned after my arrival at Fort Sully.</p>

  <p>The night before our departure from the Blackfeet village, en route
    for the fort, I was lying awake, and heard the chief address his
    men seriously upon the subject of their wrongs at the hands of the
    whites. I now understood and spoke the Indian tongue readily, <span class="pagenum">202</span>and so
    comprehended his speech, which, as near as I can recollect, was as
    follows:</p>

  <p>“Friends and sons, listen to my words. You are a great and powerful
    band of our people. The inferior race, who have encroached on our
    rights and territories, justly deserve hatred and destruction. These
    intruders came among us, and we took them by the hand. We believed them
    to be friends and true speakers; they have shown us how false and cruel
    they can be.</p>

  <p>“They build forts to live in and shoot from with their big guns. Our
    people fall before them. Our game is chased from the hills. Our women
    are taken from us, or won to forsake our lodges, and wronged and
    deceived.</p>

  <p>“It has only been four or five moons since they drove us to
    desperation, killed our brothers and burned our tipis. The Indian cries
    for vengeance! There is no truth nor friendship in the white man;
    deceit and bitterness are in his words.</p>

  <p>“Meet them with equal cunning. Show them no mercy. They are but few, we
    are many. Whet your knives and string your bows; sharpen the tomahawk
    and load the rifle.</p>

  <p>“Let the wretches die, who have stolen our lands, and we will be free
    to roam over the soil that was our fathers’. We will come home bravely
    from battle.<span class="pagenum">203</span> Our songs shall rise among the hills, and every tipi
    shall be hung with the scalp-locks of our foes.”</p>

  <p>This declaration of hostilities was received with grunts of approval;
    and silently the war preparations went on, that I might not know the
    evil design hidden beneath the mask of friendship.</p>

  <p>That night, as if in preparation for the work he had planned, the
    gracious chief beat his poor tired squaw unmercifully, because she
    murmured at her never-ending labor and heavy tasks.</p>

  <p>His deportment to me was as courteous as though he had been educated in
    civilized life; indeed, had he not betrayed so much ignorance of the
    extent and power of the American nation, in his address to his band, I
    should have thought him an educated Indian, who had traveled among the
    whites. Yet in his brutal treatment of his squaw, his savage nature
    asserted itself, and reminded me that, although better served than
    formerly, I was still among savages.</p>

  <p>When morning came to my sleepless night, I arose, still dreading lest
    some terrible intervention should come between me and the longed-for
    journey to the abodes of white men.</p>

  <p>The day before leaving the Blackfeet village, I gave all my Indian
    trinkets to a little girl who had been my constant companion, and by
    her gentle and affectionate interest in the captive white woman, had
    created within me a feeling akin to love. She was<span class="pagenum">204</span> half white, and was
    grand-daughter of a chief called Wichunkiapa, who also treated me with
    kindness.</p>

  <p>The morning after the chief’s address to his warriors, the savages were
    all ready for the road, and, mounting in haste, set up their farewell
    chant as they wound in a long column out of the village.</p>

  <p>I have frequently been asked, since my restoration to civilization,
    how I dressed while with the Indians, and whether I was clothed as the
    squaws were. A description of my appearance as I rode out of the Indian
    village that morning, will satisfy curiosity on this point.</p>

  <p>My dress consisted of a narrow white cotton gown, composed of only two
    breadths, reaching below the knee, and fastened at the waist with a red
    scarf; moccasins, embroidered with beads and porcupine quills, covered
    my feet, and a robe over my shoulders completed my wardrobe.</p>

  <p>While with the Ogalallas, I wore on my arms great brass rings that had
    been forced on me, some of them fitting so tight that they lacerated my
    arms severely, leaving scars that I shall ever retain as mementos of my
    experience in Indian ornamentation. I was also painted as the squaws
    were, but never voluntarily applied the article.</p>

  <p>It was winter, and the ground was covered with snow, but so cold was
    the air that its surface bore the<span class="pagenum">205</span> horses’ feet on its hard, glittering
    breast, only breaking through occasionally in the deep gullies.</p>

  <p>It was two hundred miles from the Blackfeet village to Fort Sully, in
    the middle of winter, and the weather intensely cold, from the effects
    of which my ill-clad body suffered severely. I was forced to walk a
    great part of the way, to keep from freezing. Hoping for deliverance,
    yet dreading lest the treacherous plans of the Indians for the capture
    of the fort and massacre of its garrison might prove successful, and my
    return to captivity inevitable, I struggled on, striving to bear with
    patience the mental and bodily ills from which I suffered. My great
    fear was that my letter had not fallen into the right hands.</p>

  <p>On our journey we came in sight of a few lodges, and in among the
    timber we camped for the night. While in one of the lodges, to my
    surprise, a gentlemanly figure approached me, dressed in modern style.
    It astonished me to meet this gentlemanly-looking, well-mannered
    gentleman under such peculiar circumstances. He drew near and addressed
    me courteously.</p>

  <p>“This is cold weather for traveling. Do you not find it so?” he
    inquired.</p>

  <p>“Not when I find myself going in the right direction,” I replied.</p>

  <p>I asked him if he lived in that vicinity, supposing, of course, from
    the presence of a white man in our<span class="pagenum">206</span> camp, that we must be near some
    fort, trading-post, or white settlement.</p>

  <p>He smiled and said, “I am a dweller in the hills, and confess that
    civilized life has no charms for me. I find in freedom and nature all
    the elements requisite for happiness.”</p>

  <p>Having been separated from the knowledge and interests of national
    affairs just when the struggle agitating our country was at its height,
    I asked the question:</p>

  <p>“Has Richmond been taken?”</p>

  <p>“No, nor never will be,” was the reply.</p>

  <p>Further conversation on national affairs convinced me that he was a
    rank rebel.</p>

  <p>We held a long conversation, on various topics. He informed me he had
    lived with the Indians fourteen years; was born in St. Louis, had an
    Indian wife, and several children, of whom he was very proud; and he
    seemed to be perfectly satisfied with his mode of living.</p>

  <p>I was very cautious in my words with him, lest he might prove a
    traitor; but in our conversation some Indian words escaped my lips,
    which, being overheard, rumor construed into mischief. What I had said
    was carried from lodge to lodge, increasing rather than diminishing,
    until it returned to the lodge where I was. The Indians, losing
    confidence in me, sent the young men, at midnight, to the camp of the
    white man, to<span class="pagenum">207</span> ascertain what had been said by me, and my feelings
    toward them.</p>

  <p>He assured the messengers that I was perfectly friendly, had breathed
    nothing but kindliness for them, and was thoroughly contented; had so
    expressed myself, and there was no cause to imagine evil.</p>

  <p>This man trafficked and traded with the Indians, disposing of his goods
    in St. Louis and in eastern cities, and was then on his way to his
    home, near the mouth of the Yellowstone River.</p>

  <p>Early in the forenoon of the last day’s travel, my eager and anxious
    eyes beheld us nearing the fort. The Indians paused and dismounted
    to arrange their dress and see to the condition of their arms. Their
    blankets and furs were adjusted; bows were strung, and the guns
    examined by them, carefully. They then divided into squads of fifties,
    several of these squads remaining in ambush among the hills, for the
    purpose of intercepting any who might escape the anticipated massacre
    at the fort; the others then rode on toward the fort, bearing me with
    them.</p>

  <p>A painfully startling sight (the last I was destined to see), here met
    my gaze. One of the warriors, in passing, thrust out his hand to salute
    me. It was covered by one of my husband’s gloves, and the sight of such
    a memento filled me with inexpressible dread as to his fate. Nothing
    in the least way connected with him had transpired to throw any light
    upon his<span class="pagenum">208</span> whereabouts, or whether living or dead, since we had been so
    suddenly and cruelly separated. All was darkness and doubt concerning
    him.</p>

  <p>Mr. Kelly had been a Union soldier, and happening to have his discharge
    papers with me at the time of my capture, I had been able to secrete
    them ever since, treasuring them merely because they had once belonged
    to him and contained his name.</p>

  <p>Now, as we approached the place where his fate would be revealed to
    me, and, if he lived, we would meet once more, the appearance of that
    glove, on the savage hand, was like a touch that awakened many chords,
    some to thrill with hope, some to jar painfully with fear.</p>

  <p>In appearance I had suffered from my long estrangement from home life.
    I had been obliged to paint daily, like the rest of my companions, and
    narrowly escaped tattooing, by pretending to faint away every time the
    implements for the marring operation were applied.</p>

  <p>During the journey, whenever an opportunity offered, I would use a
    handful of snow to cleanse my cheeks from savage adornment; and now,
    as we drew nearer the fort, and I could see the chiefs arranging
    themselves for effect, my heart beat high, and anticipation became so
    intense as to be painful.</p>

  <p>Eight chiefs rode in advance, one leading my horse by the bridle, and
    the warriors rode in the rear. The <span class="pagenum">209</span>cavalcade was imposing. As we
    neared the fort they raised the war song, loud and wild, on the still,
    wintry air; and, as if in answer to its notes, the glorious flag of our
    country was run up, and floated bravely forth on the breeze from the
    tall flag-staff within the fort.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_208.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">My Arrival at Fort Sully.</div>
  </div>

  <p>My eyes caught the glad sight, and my heart gave a wild bound of joy;
    something seemed to rise in my throat and choke my breathing. Every
    thing was changed; the torture of suspense, the agony of fear, and
    dread of evil to come, all seemed to melt away like mist before the
    morning sunshine, when I beheld the precious emblem of liberty. How
    insignificant and contemptible in comparison were the flaunting Indian
    flags that had so long been displayed to me; and how my heart thrilled
    with a sense of safety and protection as I saw the roofs of the
    buildings within the fort covered by the brave men who composed that
    little garrison.</p>

  <p>The precious emblem of liberty, whose beloved stripes and stars floated
    proudly out, seemed to beckon me to freedom and security; and as the
    fresh breeze stirred its folds, shining in the morning light, and
    caused them to wave lightly to and fro, they came like the smile of
    love and the voice of affection, all combined, to welcome me to home
    and happiness once more.</p>

  <p>An Indian hanger-on of the fort had sauntered carelessly forward a
    few minutes previous, as if actuated<span class="pagenum">210</span> by curiosity, but in reality to
    convey intelligence to his fellow-savages of the state of the fort and
    its defenses.</p>

  <p>Then the gate was opened, and Major House appeared, accompanied by
    several officers and an interpreter, and received the chiefs who rode
    in advance.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Captain Logan (the officer of the day), a man whose kind and
    sympathetic nature did honor to his years and rank, approached me. My
    emotions were inexpressible, now that I felt myself so nearly rescued.
    At last they overcame me. I had borne grief and terror and privation;
    but the delight of being once more among my people was so overpowering
    that I almost lost the power of speech, or motion, and when I faintly
    murmured, “Am I free, indeed free?” Captain Logan’s tears answered me
    as well as his scarcely uttered “Yes,” for he realized what freedom
    meant to one who had tasted the bitterness of bondage and despair.</p>

  <p>As soon as the chiefs who accompanied me entered the gate of the fort,
    the commandant’s voice thundered the order for them to be closed.</p>

  <p>The Blackfeet were shut out, and I was beyond their power to recapture.</p>

  <p>After a bondage lasting more than five months, during which I had
    endured every torture, I once more stood free, among people of my own
    race, all<span class="pagenum">211</span> ready to assist me, and restore me to my husband’s arms.</p>

  <p>Three ladies, residing at the fort, received me, and cheerfully
    bestowed every care and attention which could add to my comfort
    and secure my recovery from the fatigues and distresses of my past
    experience.</p>

      VISIT FROM THE COMMANDANT OF FORT RICE&mdash;ARRIVAL OF MY
      HUSBAND&mdash;AFFECTING SCENE.</div>
  </div>

  <p><span class="smcap">At</span> first, and some time afterward, at intervals, the effects of my
    life among the savages preyed upon my mind so as to injure its quiet
    harmony. I was ill at ease among my new friends, and they told me
    that my eyes wore a strangely wild expression, like those of a person
    constantly in dread of some unknown alarm.</p>

  <p>Once more free and safe among civilized people, I looked back on the
    horrible past with feelings that defy description.</p>

  <p>The thought of leaving this mortal tenement on the desert plain for
    the wolves to devour, and the bones to bleach under the summer sun
    and winter frosts, had been painful indeed. Now, I knew that if the
    wearied spirit should leave its earthly home, the body would be cared
    for by kind Christian friends, and tenderly laid beneath the grass and
    flowers, and my heart rejoiced therein.</p>

  <p>Hunger and thirst, long days of privation and<span class="pagenum">213</span> suffering, had been
    mine. No friendly voices cheered me on; all was silence and despair.
    But now the scene had changed, and the all-wise Being, who is cognizant
    of every thought, knew the joy and gratitude of my soul.</p>

  <p>True, during the last few weeks of my captivity, the Indians had done
    all in their power for me, all their circumstances and condition would
    allow, and the women were very kind, but “their people were not my
    people,” and I was detained a captive, far from home, and friends, and
    civilization.</p>

  <p>With Alexander Selkirk I could say, “Better dwell in the midst of
    alarms, than reign in this horrible place.”</p>

  <p>Being young, and possessed of great cheerfulness and elasticity of
    temper, I was enabled to bear trials which seemed almost impossible for
    human nature to endure and live.</p>

  <p>Soon after my arrival at the fort, Captain Pell came and invited me to
    go to a trader’s store to obtain a dress for myself. I needed it very
    much, having no clothing of my own to wear.</p>

  <p>A kind lady, Mrs. Davis, accompanied me, and the sight that presented
    itself to my wondering eyes will never be erased from memory.</p>

  <p>By the door-steps, on the porches, and every-where, were groups of
    hungry Indians of all sizes and both sexes, claiming to be friendly.</p>

  <p>Some of them were covered with every conceivable<span class="pagenum">214</span> kind of superficial
    clothing and adornment, and critically wanting in cleanliness, a
    peculiar trait among the Indians of the Northwest.</p>

  <p>There was the papoose, half-breeds of any number, a few absolutely
    nude, others wrapped slightly in bits of calico, a piece of buckskin,
    or fur.</p>

  <p>Speculators, teamsters, and interpreters, mingled with the soldiers of
    the garrison&mdash;squaws, with their bright, flashing shawls, or red cloth,
    receiving, in their looped-up blanket, the various articles of border
    traffic, such as sugar, rice, flour, and other things&mdash;tall warriors
    bending over the same counter, purchasing tobacco, brass nails, knives,
    and glass beads, all giving words to thought, and a stranger might
    well wonder which was the better prototype of tongues. The Cheyennes
    supplement their words with active and expressive gestures, while the
    Sioux amply use their tongues as well as their arms and fingers.</p>

  <p>To all, whether half-breed, Indian, or white man, the gentlemanly
    trader gave kind and patient attention, while himself and clerks seemed
    ready and capable of talking Sioux, French, or English, just as the
    case came to hand.</p>

  <p>It was on the 12th of December when I reached the fort, and like heaven
    the place appeared after the trials of savage life.</p>

  <p>The officers and men were like brothers to me; and their tender
    sympathy united me to them in the<span class="pagenum">215</span> strongest bonds of friendship, which
    not even death can sever.</p>

  <p>A party and supper was made for my special benefit, and on New Year’s
    morning I was serenaded with cannon. Every attention and kindness was
    bestowed upon me; and to Dr. John Ball, post surgeon, I owe a debt
    of gratitude which mere words can never express. He was my attendant
    physician during my sojourn at the fort, and, as my physical system had
    undergone very severe changes, I needed great care. Under his skillful
    treatment and patient attention I soon recovered health and strength.
    I had been severely frozen on the last days of my journey with the
    Indians toward the fort.</p>

  <p>Colonel Diamond, from Fort Rice, came to visit me ere I left Fort
    Sully. He was attended by an escort of one hundred and eighty men.</p>

  <p>He told me of his efforts to obtain my release, and that he, with his
    men, had searched the Indian village for me, but found no warriors
    there, as they had already taken me to the fort. The Indian women had
    made him understand by signs that the “White Woman” had gone with the
    chiefs.</p>

  <p>He said the Indians were so enraged about giving me up, that they
    killed three of his men and scalped them, by orders from the chief,
    Ottawa, who was unable to do any service himself, being a cripple. He
    bade them bring him the scalps of the white men.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">216</span></p>

  <p>An Indian, who killed one of the men, fell dead in his lodge the
    same day, which frightened his people not a little; for, in their
    superstition, they deemed it a visitation of the Great Spirit for a
    wrong done.</p>

  <p>Colonel Diamond did not forget me, neither did he cease in his efforts
    in my behalf.</p>

  <p>During all this time no tidings had been received by me of my husband.
    But one day, great commotion was occasioned in the fort by the
    announcement that the mail ambulance was on the way to the fort, and
    would reach it in a few moments. An instant after, a soldier approached
    me, saying: “Mrs. Kelly, I have news for you. Your husband is in the
    ambulance.”</p>

  <p>No person can have even a faint idea of the uncontrollable emotions
    which swept over me like an avalanche at that important and startling
    news. But it was not outwardly displayed. The heart-strings were
    stirred to their utmost depths, but gave no sound. Trembling, quivering
    in their strong feeling, they told not of the deep grief and joy
    intermingled there.</p>

  <p>Mechanically, I moved around, awaiting the presence of the beloved,
    and was soon folded to his breast, where he held me with a grasp as if
    fearful of my being torn from him again.</p>

  <p>Not an eye present but was suffused with tears. Soldiers and men, the
    ladies who had been friends to me, all mingled their tears and prayers.
    Language fails to describe our meeting. For seven long months<span class="pagenum">217</span> we had
    not beheld each other, and the last time was on the terrible field of
    slaughter and death.</p>

  <p>His personal appearance, oh! how changed! His face was very pale, and
    his brown hair was sprinkled with gray. His voice was alone unchanged.
    He called me by name, and it never sounded so sweet before. His very
    soul seemed imbued with sadness at our separation, and the terrible
    events which caused it.</p>

  <p>My first question was concerning my little Mary; for her fate had been
    veiled in mystery. He gave me the account of her burial&mdash;a sad and
    heart-rending story, sufficient to chill the lightest heart&mdash;which
    account comprises the succeeding chapter.</p>

    <div class="subheadc">SAD FATE OF LITTLE MARY.</div>
  </div>

  <p><span class="smcap">The</span> reader will please go back with me to that fearful first night of
    my captivity, and to the moment when I put into execution the plan
    for dear little Mary’s escape, which I prayed might result in her
    restoration to our friends.</p>

  <p>It must have been something more than a vague hope of liberty to be
    lost or won that guided the feeble steps of the child back on the trail
    to a bluff overlooking the road where, weary from the fatigue and
    terror of a night passed alone on the prairie, she sat, anxious, but
    hopeful, awaiting the coming of friends.</p>

  <p>Rescue was seemingly near, now that she had reached the great road, and
    she knew that there would be a passing train of emigrants ere long.</p>

  <p>It was in this situation she was seen by some passing soldiers, holding
    out her little trembling hands with eager joy and hope, imploring them
    to save her.</p>

  <p>It was a party of but three or four soldiers returning from Fort
    Laramie, where they had been to meet the paymaster. They had been
    pursued by Indians<span class="pagenum">219</span> the day before; had also passed the scene of the
    destruction of our train; and believed the country swarming with
    Indians. Their apprehensions were, therefore, fully aroused, and,
    fearing the little figure upon the distant bluff might be a decoy to
    lead them into ambush, hesitated to approach. There was a large ravine
    between, and it is not strange that their imagination should people it
    with lurking savages. However, they were about crossing to the relief
    of the little girl, when a party of Indians came in sight, and they
    became convinced it was a decoy, and turned and fled.</p>

  <p>They returned to Deer Creek Station, and related the circumstance. Mr.
    Kelly, arriving soon after, heard it, and his heart sank within him at
    the description of the child, for he thought he recognized in it the
    form of our little Mary.</p>

  <p>He applied to the officer in command for a detail of soldiers to go
    with him to search for her, but all entreaty and argument were in vain.</p>

  <p>The agony that poor child endured as the soldiers turned away, and the
    war-whoop of the savage rang upon her terrified soul, is known only to
    God. Instead of the rescue and friends which, in her trusting heart and
    innocent faith, she had expected to find, fierce Indians stood before
    her, stringing their bows to take her life, thus to win another trophy,
    marking the Indian murderer.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">220</span></p>

  <p>The whizzing arrows were sent into the body of the helpless child, and
    with the twang of the bow-strings, the delicate form of the heroic
    child lay stretched upon the ground, and the bright angel spirit went
    home to rest in the bosom of its Father.</p>

  <p>On the morning of the 14th, two days after Mary was seen, Mr. Kelly
    succeeded in obtaining a squad of soldiers at the station, and went out
    to search for the child, and after a short march of eight miles, they
    discovered the mutilated remains of the murdered girl.</p>

  <p>Mr. Kelly’s grief and anguish knew no bounds.</p>

  <p>Three arrows had pierced the body, and the tomahawk and scalping-knife
    had done their work. When discovered, her body lay with its little
    hands outstretched as if she had received, while running, the fatal
    arrows.</p>

  <p>Surely He who numbers the sparrows and feeds the ravens was not
    unmindful of her in that awful hour, but allowed the heavenly kingdom,
    to which her trembling soul was about to take its flight, to sweeten,
    with a glimpse of its beatific glory, the bitterness of death, even as
    the martyr Stephen, seeing the bliss above, could not be conscious of
    the torture below.</p>

  <p>Extracting the arrows from the wounds, and dividing her dress among the
    soldiers, then tenderly wrapping her in a winding sheet, Mr. Kelly had
    the sad satisfaction of smoothing the earth on the unconscious breast
    that had ceased to suffer, and when this duty was performed, <span class="pagenum">221</span>they left
    the little grave all alone, far from the happy home of her childhood,
    and the brothers, with whom she had played in her innocent joy.</p>

  <p>Of all strange and terrible fates, no one who had seen her gentle face
    in its loving sweetness, the joy and comfort of our hearts, would
    have predicted such a barbarous fate for her. But it was only the
    passage from death into life, from darkness into daylight, from doubt
    and fear into endless love and joy. Those little ones, whose spirits
    float upward from their downy pillows, amid the tears and prayers of
    broken-hearted friends, are blest to enter in at heaven’s shining gate,
    which lies as near little Mary’s rocky, blood-stained pillow in the
    desolate waste as the palace of a king, and when she had once gained
    the great and unspeakable bliss of heaven, it must have blotted out the
    remembrance of the pain that won it, and made no price too great for
    such delight.</p>

      MEANS OF RESTORING ANOTHER WHITE WOMAN AND CHILD&mdash;HER RESCUERS
      HUNG FOR FORMER MURDERS&mdash;A LETTER ANNOUNCING MY SAFE ARRIVAL AT
      FORT SULLY.</div>
  </div>

  <p><span class="smcap">Immediately</span> after Mr. Kelly reached Deer Creek, at the time of our
    capture, he telegraphed to Fort Laramie of the outbreak of the Indians,
    and the capture of his wife.</p>

  <p>Colonel Collins, of the Eleventh Ohio Cavalry, commandant of the
    military district, ordered two companies, under Captain Shuman and
    Captain Marshall, two brave and daring men, to pursue and rescue me,
    and chastise the savages in case of resistance.</p>

  <p>But the distance of one hundred miles lay between these forts, and
    they only arrived on their way too late for rescue. They continued
    their march, however, and after an absence of three days returned
    unsuccessful.</p>

  <p>Sad to relate, a young and daring officer, Lieutenant Brown, of the
    Eleventh Ohio Volunteers, fell a victim<span class="pagenum">224</span> to savage cruelty in my
    behalf, for with a view of prospecting the neighborhood, he, with Mr.
    Kelly, left the main body with a small squad of men in quest of the
    Indians.</p>

  <p>Coming suddenly upon a band of warriors, in their encampment, the brave
    Lieutenant indiscreetly ordered an attack, but the men, seeing the
    futility of opposing such numbers, fled, and left Mr. Kelly and the
    officer.</p>

  <p>Becoming conscious of his dangerous situation, he feigned friendship,
    addressing them in the usual way, “How koda?” which means, How do you
    do, friend?</p>

  <p>But they were not to be deceived, and sent an arrow, causing him to
    fall from his horse, and the effects of which caused his death a few
    hours afterward.</p>

  <p>He was immediately reported dead, and with all the speed the men could
    command they pursued his murderers; but the fresher horses of the
    savages carried them off beyond their reach, and the soldiers were
    compelled to return in disappointment.</p>

  <p>Brave young man! the ardent friend of Mr. Kelly, and the husband and
    father of an affectionate wife and child, stricken down in his early
    manhood, we would humbly lay the wreath of “immortelles” upon thy
    lonely grave.</p>

  <p>After several expeditions in like manner which proved unsuccessful, Mr.
    Kelly offered a reward of nineteen horses, the money value of which was
    deposited <span class="pagenum">225</span>with the commander of Fort Laramie, and it was circulated
    through all the Indian villages, that upon my safe delivery the reward
    would be paid.</p>

  <p>Every effort possible was made by my husband and his brothers to
    procure my rescue or ransom. No money or efforts were spared, and the
    long days of agonizing suspense to them were worse than death.</p>

  <p>The reward which had been offered for my ransom was the means of
    rescuing another white woman, a Mrs. Ewbanks, and her child, held by
    the Indians.</p>

  <p>The Indian Two-Face and his son, having a desire to enhance their
    fortunes, paid a few small sums to the other Indians who claimed her,
    and, taking her with them, set out for Fort Laramie.</p>

  <p>When they arrived within a few miles of the fort, the prisoners were
    left with the son and some others, while Two-Face preceded them to
    arrange the terms of sale.</p>

  <p>The commander agreed to the price, and on the following day Mrs.
    Ewbanks and her child were brought in&mdash;the Indians thinking it made no
    difference which white woman it was. This was several months after my
    capture.</p>

  <p>Instead of paying the price, the commandant seized and confined them
    in the guard-house, to await trial for the murder of the ranch-men and
    the stealing of women and children. The testimony of Mrs. Ewbanks was
    proof sufficient. They confessed their crimes, and were executed in May
    following.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">226</span></p>

  <p>In crossing the North Platte River, five miles below the fort, Mrs.
    Ewbanks had suffered intensely, her child being bound to her back, and
    she holding on to a log bound by a rope fastened to the saddle of the
    Indian’s horse.</p>

  <p>The chief passed over easily, but mother and child were nearly frozen
    to death by clinging and struggling among masses of broken ice, and
    protected only by a thin, light garment.</p>

  <p>Mr. Kelly sent deputations of Indians with horses, to the Indian
    villages, with letters to me, which were never delivered. They were not
    true to their trust, but would come to see me without giving me the
    messages, then return with the declaration that I could not be found.</p>

  <p>He would furnish a complete outfit for an Indian, costing about four
    hundred dollars, and send him to find me; but the Indian cared only for
    the money; he would never return.</p>

  <p>Having despaired of accomplishing any thing further toward my rescue
    at Fort Laramie, he left for Leavenworth, to obtain help from citizens
    there, to get permission of the commander of the division to raise an
    independent company for my release.</p>

  <p>There he met with his brother, General Kelly, who had just returned
    from the South, and had received a letter from me, acquainting him with
    my freedom.</p>

  <p>Mr. Kelly would not at first be convinced, but, after<span class="pagenum">227</span> being shown the
    letter, he said, “Yes, I know that is Fanny’s writing, but it can not
    be possible,” and by daylight he was on his way to Dakota.</p>

  <p>Who can tell his varied emotions, during that long and wearisome
    journey, when, at the end, hope held out to him the cup of joy which,
    after the long suffering of months, he was about to drink. Let only
    those judge who have been separated from the dearest on earth, and
    whose fate was involved in mysterious silence, more painful than if the
    pallid face rested beneath the coffin-lid.</p>

      CHILD&mdash;A HAPPY MEETING.</div>
  </div>

  <p><span class="smcap">Fort Sully</span> was garrisoned by three companies of the Sixth Iowa Cavalry,
    and I should be recreant to every sense of justice did I not more
    particularly express my gratitude to them all&mdash;officers and men&mdash;for
    the delicate, more than brotherly, kindness shown me during my stay of
    two months among them.</p>

  <p>They had fought gallantly during that summer, and punished severely the
    Indians who held me captive; and though my sufferings at the time were
    increased tenfold thereby, I believe the destitute condition of the
    Indians had much to do with my final restoration to freedom. Had there
    been plenty of food in the Indian villages, none would have gone to
    Fort Sully to make a treaty.</p>

  <p>On each of the two evenings we remained at the fort after my husband’s
    arrival, we were honored with a “feast,” in marked contrast with those
    I had attended while with the savages. Stewed oysters relished <span class="pagenum">229</span>better
    than stewed dog, and the abundance of other good things, with the
    happy-looking, kind, sympathetic faces of my own people around the
    board, filled me with a feeling of almost heavenly content.</p>

  <p>Mr. Harry Chatterton presided at the first, and, in a feeling manner,
    expressed the delight and satisfaction his comrades and himself
    experienced in this hour of our re-union:</p>

  <div class="center-container">

        <div class="i1">To crush your love&mdash;it had no power&mdash;</div>
        <div class="i1">Tho’ long divided, you’ve met once more</div>

  </div>

  <p>“May the good Father of mercies ever protect and bless you; make the
    sun of happiness to brightly shine upon you, and may it never again be
    dimmed by stern misfortune! is the earnest and heartfelt wish of every
    person in this fort to-day.”</p>

  <p>With deep emotion these words were spoken, and we felt convinced they
    were from the innermost depths of the heart.</p>

  <p>How many affectionate, generous natures are among us, whom we can never
    appreciate until some heavy cloud drops down upon us, and they, with
    their cheerful <span class="pagenum">230</span>words and kind acts, assist us to rise, and in hours of
    joy they are ready to grasp us by the hand, and welcome us to happiness?</p>

  <p>Anxious for a re-union with our friends, and to be once more with
    my dear mother, we bade farewell to those who had shown us so much
    kindness and attention, and commenced our journey at daylight, to
    prevent the Indians, many of whom remained about the fort, knowing of
    my departure, as I was in constant dread of recapture.</p>

  <p>Fort Sully is on the Missouri River, three hundred miles from Sioux
    City, by land, which distance we traveled in an ambulance. At all
    the military posts, stations, and towns through which we passed,
    all&mdash;military and civilians&mdash;seemed to vie with each other in kindness
    and attention. Those living in frontier towns know what the nature of
    the Indian is, and could most heartily sympathize with one who had
    suffered from captivity among them.</p>

  <p>At Yankton I received particularly kind attention, from Mrs. Ash, of
    the Ash Hotel, who also gave me the information, elsewhere written, of
    the fate of Mrs. Dooley and Mrs. Wright. Here, also, I met a number
    of the Sixth Iowa Cavalry, to which gallant regiment I was under so
    great obligation. Dr. Bardwell, a surgeon of that regiment, who was
    at Fort Sully at the time the Blackfeet came in to make a treaty, and
    were sent off after me, and who, I had previously been<span class="pagenum">231</span> informed, was
    active in measures tending to my release, was stationed at Yankton, and
    manifested the kindness of his heart in many ways.</p>

  <p>At Sioux City, Council Bluffs, and St. Joe, crowds of visitors flocked
    to see the white woman who had been a captive with the Indians; and I
    was compelled to answer many questions. From St. Joe, we made all haste
    for Leavenworth, Kansas, where I was received by friends and relatives
    as one risen from the dead.</p>

  <p>At last we reached our old home in Geneva; the home from which we had
    departed but a few months before, lured to new fields by the brightest
    hopes of future prosperity. Alas! what disappointments had fallen to
    our lot! But soon I was clasped in my dear mother’s arms, and all my
    sorrows were swallowed up in the joy of that re-union.</p>

  <p>On the morning of our departure for the plains, she said (while tears
    of sorrow filled her eyes) that she felt as though it was our final
    farewell. Her fears were agonizing in my behalf. She seemed to have a
    presentiment of evil&mdash;a dark, portentous cloud hung over my head, she
    felt, that would burst upon me, and scatter dismay and grief&mdash;which too
    well was realized in the days that followed.</p>

  <p>I endeavored to cheer her with hope, and smilingly assured her that, as
    soon as the Pacific Railroad was completed, I should visit my home and
    her; and,<span class="pagenum">232</span> though many miles might separate us, we still would be one
    in heart; and the facilities for traveling were becoming so easy and
    rapid, we could not be separated for any great length of time. But her
    sad heart refused to be comforted. A mother’s unchanging love&mdash;stronger
    than death, faithful under every circumstance, and clinging with
    tenacity to the child of her affection, could not part with me without
    a pang of anguish, which was increased tenfold when the news of my
    capture reached her.</p>

  <p>Gradually she sank under this heavy affliction; health rapidly gave
    way, and for three long months she lay helpless, moaning and bewailing
    the loss of her children; for, scarcely had she aroused from the
    terrible stupor and grief which the news of my brother’s death from
    poison, while a soldier in the Union army, had plunged her, when this
    new and awful sorrow came like a whirlwind upon her fainting spirit.</p>

  <p>But God is good. In his great mercy he spared us both, to meet once
    more, and a letter from my hand, telling her of my safety, reached her
    in due time; and in each other’s fond embrace we were once more folded.</p>

  <p>Oh! happy hour! Methinks the angels smiled in their celestial abodes
    when they witnessed that dear mother’s joy.</p>

  <p>The reader naturally supposes that here my narrative <span class="pagenum">233</span>ought to end;
    that, restored to husband, mother, and friends, my season of sorrow
    must be over. But not so. Other trials were in store for me, and, even
    fortified as I was by past tribulation, I sank almost despairingly
    under their affliction. Nor was I yet done with the Indians.</p>

  <p>Anxious to again establish a home, we left Geneva, went to Shawneetown,
    where we prospered; but better prospects offering farther west, we
    went to Ellsworth, a new town just staked out on the western line of
    Kansas. I was the first woman who located there. We lived in our wagon
    for a time, then built a hotel, and were prospering, when fears of the
    Indians again harassed us.</p>

  <p>The troops at Fort Harker, four miles east of Ellsworth, had been
    out, under General Hancock, in pursuit of the Indians, to punish them
    for murders and depredations committed along the line of the Pacific
    Railroad, and coming upon an Indian camp, destroyed it, inflicting a
    severe chastisement. This we knew would so exasperate the Indians as to
    render the situation of the exposed settlements one of great danger;
    and after my experience, a terrible dread of again falling into their
    hands intensified my apprehensions for our safety.</p>

  <p>The scouts, Jack Harvey and “Wild Bill,” were constantly on the
    lookout, and eagerly would we look toward the hills for any one who
    could give us news,<span class="pagenum">234</span> and gather around them, when they came from the
    front, with anxious faces and listening ears.</p>

  <p>Meantime the population of Ellsworth had rapidly increased, and
    military companies were formed for protection. Thus we lived in a
    continual state of alarm, until at last one night the signal was given
    that the Indians were approaching, when every man flew to his post,
    and the women and children fled to the places of refuge that had been
    prepared for them, an iron-clad house and a “dug-out,” or place under
    ground. I fled to the latter place, where about fifty altogether had
    congregated, and among them were three young men who were the sole
    survivors of a large family&mdash;father, mother, and two sisters&mdash;murdered
    and horribly mutilated in the Minnesota massacres.</p>

  <p>The Indians were repulsed, but they continued to harass us and threaten
    the town, so that it became necessary to apply for military protection.
    Accordingly, a number of colored troops were sent there, which imparted
    a feeling of security.</p>

  <p>But Ellsworth was doomed to a more terrible scourge, if possible, than
    the Indians had threatened to be. The troops were recently from the
    South. Soon after their arrival among us, the cholera broke out among
    them, and, spreading among the citizens, created a terrible panic. The
    pestilence was most destructive, sweeping before it old and young, and
    of all classes.</p>

  <p>My husband fell a victim to the disease.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">235</span></p>

  <p>On the 28th day of July, 1867, a violent attack of this terrible
    disease carried him off, and, in the midst of peril and cares, I was
    left a mourning, desolate widow.</p>

  <p>Being in delicate health, I was forced to flee to the East, and stopped
    at St. George, where one week after my little one was ushered into this
    world of sorrow.</p>

  <p>The people were panic-stricken in relation to the cholera, and when
    I went there, they were afraid to receive me into their homes,
    consequently I repaired to a small cabin in the outskirts of the town,
    and my adopted son and myself remained there alone for several days.</p>

  <p>A young lady, Miss Baker, called on me in great sympathy, saying she
    was not afraid of cholera, and would stay with me until after my
    confinement.</p>

  <p>I was very thankful for her kindness, and after the fear was over with
    the people, every attention that humanity could suggest was given me;
    but, alas! my heart was at home, and so deep were my yearnings, the
    physician declared it impossible for me to recover until I did go home.</p>

  <p>The events that had transpired seemed like a fearful dream.</p>

  <p>The physician who attended me went to Ellsworth to see if it was
    prudent for me to go, sending a letter immediately after, bidding me
    come, as the cholera had disappeared.</p>

  <p>Oh! how changed was that home! The voice that<span class="pagenum">236</span> had ever been as low,
    sweet music to my ear was hushed forever; the eye that had always
    met mine with smiling fondness was closed to light and me, and the
    hand so often grasped in tender love was palsied in death! Mr. Kelly,
    the noble, true, and devoted husband, my loved companion, the father
    of my innocent child, was gone. Oh! how sad that word! My heart was
    overwhelmed with grief, and that did its work, for it prostrated me on
    a bed of illness nigh unto death.</p>

  <p>Dr. McKennon very faithfully attended me during my illness, and as I
    was recovering, he was seized by severe sickness himself, which proved
    fatal.</p>

  <p>He was anxious to see me before he died, and desired assistance that he
    might be taken down stairs for the purpose.</p>

  <p>His attendants allowed him to do so, but he fainted in the attempt, and
    was laid on the floor until he recovered, then raised and placed on the
    sofa.</p>

  <p>I was then led into the room, and, seating myself beside him, he
    grasped my hand, exclaiming: “My friend, do not leave me. I have a
    brother in New York”&mdash;but his lips soon stiffened in death, and he was
    unable to utter more.</p>

  <p>It was a severe shock to my nervous system, already prostrated by
    trouble and illness, and I greatly missed his attention and care.</p>

  <p>No relative, or friend, was near to lay his weary<span class="pagenum">237</span> head upon the
    pillow; but we laid him to rest in the burial ground of Ellsworth with
    sad hearts and great emotion.</p>

  <p>In the spring I went to the end of the road further west, with an
    excursion party, to a place called Sheridan. On our return we stopped
    at Fort Hays, where I met two Indians who recognized me, and I also
    knew them. We conversed together. I learned they had a camp in the
    vicinity, and they were skulking around, reconnoitering. They were
    well treated here and very liberally dealt with. They inquired where I
    lived; I told them way off, near to the rising sun.</p>

  <p>The next morning, when the train left town, the band, riding on
    horseback, jumped the ditch, and looked into the windows of the cars,
    hoping to see me.</p>

  <p>They told the people that I belonged to them, and they would take my
    papoose and me way off to their own country; we were their property,
    and must go with them.</p>

  <p>It was supposed that if I had been in the cars the Indians would have
    attempted to take the train.</p>

      SISTERS FROM EXPOSURE&mdash;ELIZABETH SAVED BY AN INDIAN&mdash;A WHITE

      MRS. BLYNN.</div>
  </div>

  <p><span class="smcap">Some</span> few weeks after the events just related, I received a note from
    a stranger, requesting me to call on her at the dwelling of a hunter,
    where she was stopping. Her name was Elizabeth Blackwell, and emigrated
    with her parents from England, who became proselytes of the ruling
    prophet of Salt Lake City, where they remained until Elizabeth’s father
    took another wife. This created trouble; words ensued, soon followed by
    blows, and Elizabeth, in endeavoring to protect her mother, was struck
    by her brute of a father with a knife, and one of her eyes destroyed.</p>

  <p>Being discouraged and broken-hearted, the wretched mother and daughters
    (for Elizabeth had two sisters) resolved to escape. They wandered away
    among the mountains, and, having no place of shelter, all perished
    with the cold, except Elizabeth, who was found by the<span class="pagenum">239</span> Indians, nearly
    frozen to death. They lifted her up and carried her to camp, where they
    gave her every attention requisite for restoration.</p>

  <p>She remained with the Indians until she was able to go east, where she
    underwent the severe operation of having both legs amputated above the
    knee.</p>

  <p>The treatment received from the Indians so attached her to them that
    she prefers to live a forest life, and when she gave me her narrative,
    she was on her way from the States to her Indian home.</p>

  <p>Her father soon wearied of his Mormon wife, and escaped to the Rocky
    Mountains, where he became a noted highwayman. Hearing of Elizabeth’s
    residence among the Indians, he visited her, and gave her a large sum
    of money. The fate of his family had great effect on him, and remorse
    drove him to desperation.</p>

  <p>The husband of Elizabeth took his second wife and Elizabeth’s child
    from Salt Lake to Cincinnati, where they now live.</p>

  <p>She was twenty-six years old when I saw and conversed with her, a lady
    of intelligence, and once possessed more than ordinary beauty.</p>

  <p>She had just received the news of her father’s death. He was killed
    near Fort Dodge, Kansas.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth related to me many acts of cruelty she had witnessed among
    the savages, one of which was to the following effect:</p>

  <p>A woman was brought into the camp on horseback,<span class="pagenum">240</span> who had been captured
    from a train, and an Indian who was attempting to lift her from the
    horse, was shot in the act, by her own hand. This so enraged the
    savages that they cut her body in gashes, filled them with powder, and
    then set fire to it.</p>

  <p>The sight of the woman’s sufferings was too much for Elizabeth to
    endure, and she begged the savages to put an end to the victim at once,
    which accordingly was done.</p>

  <p>But although Elizabeth saw many heartless acts&mdash;many terrible
    scenes&mdash;still she had a kindly feeling toward the Indians, for they
    saved her from a horrible death by starvation and exposure, and had
    been very tender with her. She was somewhat embittered toward the white
    people, on account of her sufferings, and treatment.</p>

  <p>A short time after, General Sully invited me to Fort Harker, to see
    two white captive children, a girl of fourteen and a boy of six. They
    had been captured two years before, and the account of their treatment
    given me by the girl, was any thing but favorable. The boy was as wild
    as a deer.</p>

  <p>A Sioux woman at Fort Harker had taken these children into her own
    family and cared for them as a mother. She was the daughter of a white
    man, was born at Fort Laramie, and had married an interpreter by the
    name of Bradley. She was quite intelligent, having been educated by her
    husband.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">241</span></p>

  <p>In January, 1868, two other children were captured in the State of
    Texas by the Kiowah Indians. They were girls, aged five and three years.
    Their parents and all the known relatives had been murdered, and the
    children had been recently recovered from the Indians, and were in
    the care of J. H. Leavenworth, United States Indian Agent. Having no
    knowledge of their parentage, they were named Helen and Heloise Lincoln.</p>

  <p>Another interesting family was taken from Texas by the Indians, their
    beautiful home destroyed, and all killed with the exception of the
    mother and three daughters.</p>

  <p>Their name was Boxx. The ages of the children were respectively
    eighteen, fourteen, and ten, and they were allowed to be together for a
    time, but afterward were separated.</p>

  <p>They experienced great cruelties. The youngest was compelled to stand
    on a bed of live coals, in order to torture the mother and sisters.</p>

  <p>Lieutenant Hesselberger, the noble and brave officer, whose name will
    live forever in the hearts of the captives he rescued, heard of this
    family, and, with a party of his brave men, went immediately to the
    Indian village, and offered a reward for the captives, which at first
    was declined, but he at length succeeded in purchasing the mother and
    one girl; he afterward procured the release of the others.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">242</span></p>

  <p>Lieutenant Hesselberger braved death in so doing, and his only
    reward is the undying gratitude of those who owe their lives to his
    self-sacrificing, humane devotion and courage.</p>

  <p>In the fall of 1868, the Indians commenced depredations on the frontier
    of Kansas, and after many serious outbreaks, destroying homes and
    murdering settlers, the Governor issued a call for volunteers to assist
    General Sheridan in protecting the settlers and punishing the Indians.
    Among those who volunteered was my youngest brother, and many of my old
    schoolmates and friends from Geneva, who related to me the following
    incidents, which are fully substantiated by General Sheridan and others.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Morgan, an accomplished and beautiful bride, and Miss White, an
    educated young lady, were both taken from their homes by the Indians.
    They were living on the Republican River.</p>

  <p>During their captivity they suffered much from the inclemency of the
    weather, and it was March before they were released by General Sheridan.</p>

  <p>The troops, the Kansas boys, were all winter among the mountains,
    endeavoring to protect the frontier.</p>

  <p>They suffered great privation, being obliged sometimes to live
    on the meat of mules, and often needing food. All honor to these
    self-sacrificing men, who braved the cold and hunger of the mountains
    to protect the settlers on the frontier.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">243</span></p>

  <p>A Mrs. Blynn, whose maiden name was Harrington, of Franklin County,
    Kansas, who was married at the age of nineteen, and started with her
    young husband for the Pacific coast, was taken prisoner by the Indians
    and suffered terrible brutality.</p>

  <p>About that time the savages had become troublesome on the plains,
    attacking every wagon-train, killing men and capturing women. But the
    train in which Mr. Blynn and his wife traveled was supposed to be very
    strong, and able to repel any attack made upon them, should there be
    any such trouble.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Blynn had a presentiment of evil&mdash;of the fate of their unfortunate
    company, and her own dark impending destiny, in a dream, the
    realization of which proved too true.</p>

  <p>When she related her dream to her husband, he tried to laugh away her
    superstitious fears, and prevent its impression on her mind.</p>

  <p>It was not many days after that a large number of warriors of the Sioux
    tribe were seen in the distance, and the people of the train arranged
    themselves in a shape for attack.</p>

  <p>The Indians, seeing this preparation, and, fearing a powerful
    resistance, fired a few shots, and, with yells of rage and
    disappointment, went off.</p>

  <p>Within the succeeding days the travelers saw Indians, but they did not
    come near enough to make trouble.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">244</span></p>

  <p>Confident of no disturbance or hinderance to their journey, the happy
    emigrants journeyed on fearless (comparatively) of the red skins, and
    boasting of their power.</p>

  <p>But the evil hour at last approached. When the column had reached Sand
    Creek, and was in the act of crossing, suddenly the wild yells of
    Indians fell upon their ears, and soon a band of Cheyennes charged down
    upon them.</p>

  <p>Two wagons had already got into the stream, and, instead of hastening
    the others across, and thus putting the creek between themselves and
    their pursuers, the whites drove the two back out of the water, and,
    entangled in the others, threw every thing in confusion. This confusion
    is just what the Indians like, and they began whooping, shouting, and
    firing furiously, in order to cause a stampede of the live-stock.</p>

  <p>In five minutes all was accomplished; all the animals, except those
    well fastened to the wagons, were dashing over the prairie. The Indians
    then circled around and fired a volley of bullets and arrows. Mr. Blynn
    was killed at the second fire, while standing before the wagon in which
    were his wife and child.</p>

  <p>“God help them!” was all he said, as, firing his rifle at the Indians
    for the last time, he sank down dead.</p>

  <p>The men returned the fire for awhile, then fled, leaving their wounded,
    all their wagons, and the<span class="pagenum">245</span> women and children in the hands of the
    relentless victors.</p>

  <p>Santana, who led the band, sprang in first, followed by his braves,
    whom he ordered to let the cowardly pale faces run away without pursuit.</p>

  <p>The dead and wounded were scalped, and the women and children taken
    captive. All were treated with brutal conduct; and, having secured all
    the plunder they could, the savages set fire to every wagon, and, with
    the horses they had taken from the train, set out in the direction of
    their villages.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Blynn’s child, Willie, two years old, cried very much, which so
    enraged Santana that he seized him by the heels, and was ready to dash
    out his brains, but the poor mother, in her agony, sprang forward,
    caught the child, and fought so bravely with the infuriated murderer,
    that he laughed, and told her to keep it; for he feared she would fret
    if he killed it.</p>

  <p>Mounted on a pony, her child in her arms, she endeavored to please her
    savage captor by appearing satisfied, dwelling on the hope that some
    event would occur, whereby she might be rescued and restored to her
    friends. It was for her darling child that she endeavored to keep up
    her heart and resolve to live.</p>

  <p>When they arrived at Santana’s village, Mrs. Blynn was left alone of
    all the seven who were taken. Group after group dropped away from the
    main body, taking with them the women whom they had prisoners.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">246</span></p>

  <p>Her hardships soon commenced. For a day or two she was fed
    sufficiently; but afterward all that she had to eat she got from the
    squaws in the same lodge with her; and, as they were jealous of her,
    they often refused to give her any thing, either for herself or Willie.</p>

  <p>An Indian girl, in revenge for an injury done her by Santana, the
    murder of her best friend, became a spy for General Sheridan, and
    endeavored by every means in her power to rescue Mrs. Blynn from the
    grasp of these savages; but her efforts were unsuccessful. She was a
    true friend to the unfortunate lady, giving her food, and endeavoring
    to cheer her with the promise of rescue and safe deliverance.</p>

  <p>The squaws abused her shamefully in the absence of Santana, burning her
    with sharp sticks and splinters of resinous wood, and inflicting the
    most excruciating tortures upon her. Her face, breasts, and limbs were
    one mass of wounds. Her precious little one was taken by the hair of
    the head and punished with a stick before her helpless gaze.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Blynn, the captive, previous to this torture, had written a letter
    to the general commanding the department, whoever he might be, and sent
    it by the Indian girl.</p>

  <p>We insert a copy of this letter, which is sufficient to draw tears from
    the eye of any one who may read it.</p>

  </blockquote>

  <p>Mrs. Blynn passed her time in drudgery, hoping against hope up to the
    morning of the battle, when General Sheridan’s gallant soldiers, under
    the command of General Custer, came charging with loud huzzahs upon the
    village.</p>

  <p>Black Kettle’s camp was the first attacked, though all the village was,
    of course, aroused.</p>

  <p>The heart of Mrs. Blynn must have beat wildly, mingling with hope and
    dread, when she heard the noise and firing, and saw the United States
    soldiers charging upon her captors.</p>

  <p>Springing forward, she exclaimed: “Willie, Willie, saved at last!” but
    the words were scarce on her lips, ere the tomahawk of the revengeful
    Santana was buried in her brain; and in another instant little Willie
    was in the grasp of the monster, and his head dashed against a tree;
    then, lifeless, he was thrown upon the dying mother’s breast, whose
    arms instinctively closed<span class="pagenum">249</span> around the dead baby boy, as though she
    would protect him to the last moment of her life.</p>

  <p>General Sheridan and his staff, in searching for the bodies of Major
    Elliott and his comrades, found these among the white soldiers, and
    they were tenderly carried to Fort Cobb, where, in a grave outside the
    stockade, mother and child lie sleeping peacefully, their once bruised
    spirits having joined the loved husband and father in the land where
    captivity is unknown.</p>

  <p>Surely, if heaven is gained by the sorrows of earth, this little family
    will enjoy the brightest scenes of the celestial world.</p>

    <div class="subhead">MOVE TO WYOMING&mdash;FALSE FRIENDS&mdash;THE MANUSCRIPT OF MY NARRATIVE
      TAKEN BY ANOTHER PARTY AND PUBLISHED&mdash;I GO TO WASHINGTON.</div>
  </div>

  <p><span class="smcap">Mr. Kelly’s</span> sudden death, my own sickness, and the scourge of cholera,
    all coming at one time, proved disastrous to me in a pecuniary way. I
    was defrauded in every way, even to the robbing of my husband’s body
    of the sum of five hundred dollars the day of his death. However, I
    finally disposed of the remnant of property left, and started for
    Wyoming, where lived the only persons beside myself who survived the
    attack on our train. They had prospered, and in a spirit of kindness,
    as I then thought, invited and prevailed on me to share their home.</p>

  <p>It proved a most disastrous move for me. My leisure hours, since my
    release from captivity, had been devoted to preparing for publication,
    in book form, a narrative of my experience and adventures among the
    Indians, and it was completed. The manuscript was surreptitiously
    taken, and a garbled, imperfect account of my captivity issued as the
    experience of my false friend, who, by the aid of an <span class="pagenum">251</span>Indian, escaped
    after a durance of only one day and night.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_250.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">Red Cloud, the Orator Sioux Chief.</div>
  </div>

  <p>I remained in Wyoming one year, then started for Washington, resolved
    to present a claim to the Government for losses sustained at the hands
    of the Indians. I knew what difficulties beset my path, but duty to my
    child urged me on, and I was not without some hope of success.</p>

  <p>After learning of my captivity through Captain Fisk, President Lincoln
    had issued orders to the different military commanders that my freedom
    from the Indians must be purchased at any price; and my sad story
    was well known to the then existing authorities when I arrived in
    Washington.</p>

  <p>President Grant, learning through a friend from Colorado of my
    presence, sent for me, and assured me of his warmest sympathy. He was
    cognizant of what had already transpired relative to me, and told me
    the papers were on file in the War Department, in charge of General
    Sherman.</p>

  <p>In presenting my claim, many difficulties had to be encountered; but
    members of Congress, realizing that some compensation was due me, and
    understanding the delay that would result from a direct application to
    the Indian Bureau, introduced a bill appropriating to me five thousand
    dollars for valuable services rendered the Government in saving Captain
    Fisk’s train from destruction, and by timely warning saving Fort Sully<span class="pagenum">252</span>
    from pillage, and its garrison from being massacred. This was done
    without my having any knowledge of it until after the bill had passed
    both houses of Congress and become a law.</p>

  <p>During my stay in Washington, Red Cloud, and a delegation of chiefs and
    head warriors from the different tribes of the Dakota or Sioux nation,
    arrived. They all recognized me as once having been with their people,
    and seemed quite rejoiced at the meeting.</p>

  <p>Some of the good Christian people of the city extended to the Indians,
    through me, an invitation to attend church one Sabbath, which I made
    known to Red Cloud, telling him of the great organ, the fine music they
    would hear, and of the desire the good people had to benefit their
    souls.</p>

  <p>Red Cloud replied with dignity that he did not have to go to the big
    house to talk to the Great Spirit; he could sit in his tipi or room,
    and the Great Spirit would listen. The Great Spirit was not where the
    big music was. No, he would not go.</p>

  <p>None of the Indians accepted the invitation; but some of the squaws
    went, escorted to the church in elegant carriages; but they soon
    left in disgust. The dazzling display of fine dresses, the beautiful
    church, and the “big music”&mdash;none of these had interest for them, if
    unaccompanied by a feast.</p>

  <p>I attended several of the councils held with the Indians. <span class="pagenum">253</span>At one of
    them, Red Cloud addressed Secretary Cox and Commissioner Parker in a
    lengthy speech on the subject of his grievances, in which he referred
    to me as follows. Pointing me out to the Secretary and Commissioner, he
    said:</p>

  <p>“Look at that woman; she was captured by Silver Horn’s party. I wish
    you to pay her what her captors owe her. I am a man true to what I say,
    and want to keep my promise. I speak for all my nation. The Indians
    robbed that lady there, and through your influence I want her to be
    paid out of the first money due us.” Placing his finger first upon the
    breast of the Secretary and then of the Commissioner, as if to add
    emphasis to what he was about to say, he added, “Pay her out of our
    money; do not give the money into any but her own hands; then the right
    one will get it.”</p>

  <p>In one of my interviews with the chiefs, Red Cloud, Spotted Tail, and
    others desired me to get up a paper setting forth my claims against
    their people, and they would sign it. I accordingly made out a bill
    of items and presented it to them, with my affidavit, and a statement
    setting forth the circumstances of capture and robbery, which was fully
    explained to them by their interpreter.</p>

  <p>This document the chiefs representing the different bands signed
    readily. It is inserted elsewhere, with other documents corroborative
    of the truth of this narrative. <span class="pagenum">254</span>It is also signed by another
    delegation of chiefs I met in New York.</p>

  <p>With this last interview with the delegation of Indians I met in New
    York ends, I trust forever, my experience with Indians. The preparation
    of the manuscript for this plain, simple narrative of facts in my
    experience, has not been without its pangs. It has seemed, while
    writing it, as if with the narration of each incident, I was living
    over again the fearful life I led while a captive; and often have I
    laid aside the pen to get rid of the feelings which possessed me. But
    my task is completed; and with the ending of this chapter, I hope to
    lay aside forever all regretful remembrances of my captivity, and,
    looking only at the silvery lining to be found in every cloud, enjoy
    the happiness which every one may find in child-like trust in Him who
    ordereth all things well.</p>

    <div class="subheadc">GENERAL SULLY’S EXPEDITION.</div>
  </div>

  <p><span class="smcap">During</span> the summer of 1864, and while I was a prisoner with the Indians,
    an expedition, composed of Iowa and Minnesota volunteers, with a few
    independent companies of Nebraska and Dakota men, with one company of
    friendly Indians of various tribes, started from Fort Sully, in Dakota,
    with the double purpose, under instructions from the War Department,
    of escorting a large emigrant train safely through the Indian country
    on their way to Idaho, and, if possible, to inflict such punishment on
    the hostile bands they might meet as would make them willing to sue for
    peace.</p>

  <p>The expedition was commanded by General Alfred Sully, of the United
    States Army, a brave, skillful officer, and veteran Indian fighter,
    having spent the best part of twenty-five years’ service on the
    frontier. He was a captain of infantry under General Harney, in
    his memorable campaign of 1857, and was present at the battle of
    Ash Hollow, where Harney surprised a large band of Indians, with
    their families, who were<span class="pagenum">256</span> slaughtered indiscriminately, inflicting
    such punishment as made the name of General Harney a terror to the
    Indians, and, at the same time, brought upon his head the execration
    of thin-skinned philanthropists, who thought savages&mdash;the “noble red
    men” of their imagination&mdash;should be conquered only by a sugarplum and
    rose-water policy.</p>

  <p>For many interesting particulars of this expedition, and its bearing
    upon some of the incidents of my captivity and final ransom, I
    am indebted to the correspondence of one who was a member of the
    expedition, written to his family during its progress.</p>

  <p>The first day’s march carries the command to the Cheyenne River, where
    the topographical engineer, to whom I have referred, was killed. His
    fate was sad, indeed. An officer in the regular army, he served with
    distinction in the South during the rebellion, participating in over
    fifty battles, and passing through all without a wound. He was captured
    by the rebels, paroled, and sent to join General Sully’s expedition, to
    make a topographical survey of the country.</p>

  <p>Having faced danger on many a well-contested field, he held the Indian
    in utter contempt, and roamed the country along the line of march with
    reckless indifference to danger.</p>

  <p>A short time before reaching the place where the command intended to
    go into camp, Captain Fielner started in advance, accompanied by only
    one man, a<span class="pagenum">257</span> half-breed. Reaching the river, they dismounted, and were
    about fastening their horses to graze near a grove of wild plum-trees,
    when two Indians stepped out, and one of them shot Captain Fielner,
    the ball from his rifle passing through both arms and the breast. The
    advance guard arriving soon after, word was sent back to General Sully,
    who ordered the company of Dakota Cavalry to deploy and occupy so much
    of the country as to make it impossible for the Indians to escape. This
    was done, and, closing toward a center, the two savages were found in a
    “buffalo wallow,” a depression in the ground made by the buffaloes, and
    forming a very good rifle-pit. Being addressed in their own language,
    they refused to surrender, and were shot. General Sully afterward had
    their heads cut off: and when the command left camp next morning, they
    graced two pointed stakes on the bank of the river, placed there as a
    warning to all straggling Indians.</p>

  <p>The feeling manifested by General Sully on the occasion of Captain
    Fielner’s death was intense. A brave officer, a scientific scholar,
    and a gentleman of rare social qualities, he had won upon the kindlier
    feelings of his associates in rank, and was respected by all. His
    untimely death was sincerely mourned by the whole command.</p>

  <p>Death by the hand of the enemy had seldom touched that little army&mdash;so
    seldom, that when a companion failed to answer at roll-call, his
    absence was felt. The<span class="pagenum">258</span> only other officer killed during the three
    years of General Sully’s operations against the Indians was Lieutenant
    Thomas K. Leavitt, of Company B, Sixth Iowa Cavalry. At the battle
    of Whitestone Hill, in September, 1863, after the Indians had been
    utterly routed, Lieutenant Leavitt went through their deserted camp on
    foot, his horse having been shot under him; and, approaching a buffalo
    robe, raised it with the point of his saber, revealing an Indian and
    squaw, who sprang upon him so suddenly that he had no opportunity to
    defend himself, and, with their knives, stabbed him in several places.
    Darkness came on, and, separated from his companions, stripped of his
    clothing, and wounded mortally, he was all night exposed to bitter
    cold. Despite his wounds, he crawled over the ground fully a half mile,
    was found next morning, and conveyed to camp, where he died soon after.
    A young man of superior education, of a wealthy family, he relinquished
    a lucrative position in a bank, and enlisted as a private, but was soon
    promoted to a lieutenancy; and, at the time of his death, was acting
    Adjutant-General on General Sully’s staff.</p>

  <p>The emigrant train to be escorted by General Sully’s command came
    across from Minnesota, and were met at a point on the Missouri River
    about four hundred miles above Sioux City. Here the whole party crossed
    to the west bank of the Missouri, where they went into camp, and
    remained long enough to recruit<span class="pagenum">259</span> their jaded animals, preparatory to a
    long and fatiguing march into an almost unknown wilderness, jealously
    guarded by a savage foe.</p>

  <p>During this halt, Fort Rice, now one of the most important
    fortifications on the Missouri River, was built, and, when the march
    was resumed, a considerable portion of the command was left to garrison
    it.</p>

  <p>Here, also, General Sully learned that all the tribes of the Sioux
    nation had congregated in the vicinity of Knife River, determined to
    resist his passage through their country, and confident that superior
    numbers would enable them to annihilate the whole expedition, and gain
    a rich booty in horses and goods, to say nothing of the hundreds of
    scalp-locks they hoped to win as trophies of their prowess.</p>

  <p>About the middle of July the expedition took up its march westward, and
    after a few days reached Heart River. Meantime, information had been
    received, from Indians employed as scouts, that the enemy had gathered
    in strong force at a place called Ta-ka-a-ku-ta, or Deer Woods,
    about eighty miles to the northwest, and that distance out of the
    proposed route of the expedition. Accordingly, General Sully ordered
    the emigrant train and heavy army wagons corralled, rifle-pits were
    dug, and, as the emigrants were generally well armed, it was deemed
    necessary to leave only a small force of cavalry to protect them in
    case of attack.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">260</span></p>

  <p>Putting the balance of the command in light marching order, leaving
    behind tents and all other articles not absolutely necessary, the
    little band of determined men started for the camp of the enemy.
    Although the Indians were aware of the contemplated attack, such was
    the celerity of General Sully’s movements, he came within sight of
    their camp at least twenty-four hours sooner than they thought it
    possible the distance could be accomplished, taking the Indians by
    surprise, they not having time, as is their custom, to remove their
    property and women and children beyond the reach of danger.</p>

  <p>I was present with this body of Indians when the white soldiers&mdash;my
    countrymen&mdash;came in sight. Alternating between hope and fear,
    my feelings can be better imagined than described. I hoped for
    deliverance, yet feared disaster and death to that little army.</p>

  <p>At 1 o’clock in the afternoon the fight commenced, and raged, with
    great fury, until night closed on the scene of conflict, leaving the
    whites masters of the field and in possession of the Indian camp.</p>

  <p>Early in the day, I, with the women and children and old men, and such
    property as could be gathered in our hasty flight, was sent off so as
    to be out of the way, not to impede the flight of the Indians in case
    of defeat.</p>

  <p>This was a terrible blow to the Indians. About eight thousand of them
    were gathered there, and their<span class="pagenum">261</span> village, with all their property
    (except their horses and dogs), including all the stores of provisions
    they had gathered for the winter, were lost. Without shelter, without
    food, driven into a barren, desolate region, devoid of game, death from
    starvation seemed inevitable.</p>

  <p>Early next morning pursuit was commenced, but after a march of about
    five miles was abandoned, as the country beyond was impassable for
    cavalry. Returning to the scene of the previous day’s battle, General
    Sully spent several hours in destroying the property abandoned by the
    Indians in their flight. Lodge poles were piled together and fired,
    and into the flames was cast furs, robes, tents, provisions, and every
    thing that fell into the hands of the soldiers.</p>

  <p>That night the command camped about six miles from, but within sight
    of, the battle-ground, going into camp early in the afternoon. Picket
    guards were stationed on the hills, three at a post, and soon after
    the camp was thrown into commotion by the appearance of one of the
    guard dashing toward camp, at the full speed of his horse, with Indians
    in pursuit. His companions, worn out with the arduous service of the
    preceding three days, had laid down to sleep, and before the one
    remaining on guard could give the alarm, a body of Indians was close
    upon them. Discharging his rifle to arouse his companions, he had
    barely time to reach his horse and escape. The bodies<span class="pagenum">262</span> of the other two
    were found next day horribly mutilated; and that night, being within
    sight of the battle-ground, the firelight revealed the forms of a large
    body of savages dancing around the burning ruins of their own homes.</p>

  <p>Returning to Heart River, General Sully took the emigrants again in
    charge, and resumed the march toward Idaho.</p>

  <p>Traversing a country diversified and beautiful as the sun ever shone
    upon, presenting at every turn pictures of natural beauty, such as no
    artist ever represented on canvas, the expedition at last struck the
    “Mauvais Terra,” or Bad Lands, a region of the most wildly desolate
    country conceivable. No pen of writer, nor brush of painter, can give
    the faintest idea of its awful desolation.</p>

  <p>As the command halted upon the confines of this desert, the mind
    naturally reverted to political descriptions of the infernal regions
    reached in other days.</p>

  <p>The Bad Lands of Dakota extend from the confluence of the Yellow Stone
    and Missouri Rivers toward the southwest, a distance of about one
    hundred miles, and are from twenty-five to forty miles in width. The
    foot of white man had never trod these wilds before.</p>

  <p>The first day’s march into this desert carried the expedition ten miles
    only, consuming ten hours of time, and leaving the forces four miles
    from, and<span class="pagenum">263</span> within sight of, the camp, they left in the morning. On the
    7th of August, the advance guard were attacked in the afternoon by a
    large party of Indians. After a toilsome march of many days, a valley
    in the wilderness was reached, presenting an opportunity for rest, and
    here the first vegetation was found for the famished horses. In this
    valley the troops camped; the advance guard were brought back, having
    suffered some from the attack of the ambushed savages.</p>

  <p>Next day commenced one of the most memorable battles ever fought with
    Indians in the whole experience of the Government. The whole Dakota
    nation, including the supposed friendly tribes, was concentrated there,
    and numbered fully eight thousand warriors. Opposed to them was a mere
    handful, comparatively, of white men. But they were led by one skilled
    in war, and who knew the foe he had to contend against.</p>

  <p>For three days the fight raged, and, finally, on the night of the
    third day, and after a toilsome march of ten days through the “Bad
    Lands,” the command reached a broad, open country, where the savages
    made a final, desperate stand to drive the invaders back. They were
    the wild Dakotians, who had seen but little of the white settlements,
    and had a contemptuous opinion. But a new lesson was to be learned,
    and it cost them dearly. They had seen guns large and small, but the
    little mountain howitzers, from which shells were sent among them,
    they could not comprehend, and<span class="pagenum">264</span> asked the Indian scouts accompanying
    the expedition if all the wagons “shot twice.” Terrible punishment was
    inflicted upon the Indians in that three days’ fight.</p>

  <p>At the close of the second day, the brigade wagon-master reported that
    he had discovered the tracks of a white woman, and believed the Indians
    held one captive. This was the first intimation General Sully received
    of my captivity, and, not having received from the western posts any
    report of captures by Indians, thought it must be some half-breed woman
    who wore the foot gear of civilization.</p>

  <p>But the sympathetic nature of that brave, noble General was stirred to
    its depths, when his Indian scouts brought in the report that they had
    talked with the hostile foe, and they had tauntingly said, “we have a
    white woman captive.”</p>

  <p>The Indians were badly whipped, and having accomplished that portion
    of his mission, General Sully went on with his emigrant train to the
    Yellow Stone River, and beyond that there were long, toilsome marches,
    but no battles.</p>

  <p>Early in October the command arrived opposite Fort Rice, and went
    into camp. The tents of the little band of white warriors were hardly
    pitched before word came that Captain Fisk, with a large party of
    emigrants and a small escort of soldiers, had been attacked by a large
    party of Indians; had corralled their train, and could not move, but
    were on the<span class="pagenum">265</span> defensive, and were confident of holding out until relief
    should come. They were distant about one hundred and eighty miles, and
    the sympathetic nature of the veteran, while it condemned the action of
    his junior officer, thrilled with an earnest desire to save the women
    and children of that apparently doomed train.</p>

  <p>A detail of men from each company of the command was made, and
    Captain Fisk and his train of emigrants rescued from their perilous
    situation. Here was received proof positive of the fact that a white
    woman was held captive by the Indians; and while every man would have
    been willing to risk his life for her rescue, and many applications
    were made to the General for permission to go out on expeditions for
    that purpose, he had already adopted such measures as must secure her
    release.</p>

  <p>Friendly Indians who had accompanied the expedition were sent out to
    visit the various tribes, to assure them of an earnest desire on the
    part of the whites for peace, and invite them to meet at Fort Sully to
    make a treaty. The result was that about the latter part of October
    the vicinity of the fort presented an unusual appearance of animation.
    Several bands had come in, in anticipation of the big feast that had
    hitherto preceded all talks. Their disappointment may be imagined when
    they were told that no talk would be had, nor any feast given, until
    they brought in the white woman.<span class="pagenum">266</span> Their protestations, that she was not
    their captive, and that they could not get her from the band who held
    her, were of no avail, and, at length, Tall Soldier, who was thought to
    be friendly, called for volunteers to go with him for the white woman.
    About one hundred Indians responded, and the assurance was given that
    they would get the captive, if even at the expense of a fight with
    those they went to take her from.</p>

  <p>Weeks of painful suspense passed, and then came a letter from the
    captive woman, brought by an Indian, in which warning was given of
    an intent to capture the fort and murder the garrison. The warning
    was acted upon; and when, on the 12th day of December, a large body
    of Indians appeared on the bluffs overlooking the fort, that little
    band of not more than two hundred men was prepared to give them a warm
    reception should they come with hostile intent. Not only were arms in
    prime condition, but every heart beat with high resolve.</p>

  <p>When the cavalcade drew up in front of the fort, and the captive woman,
    with about twelve of her immediate savage attendants, had passed
    through the gates, they were ordered closed, shutting out the main
    body, and leaving them exposed to a raking fire from the guns in the
    bastions.</p>

  <p>But no attack was made. The Indians seemed to know that the little
    band of soldiers were prepared, and went quietly into camp, on an
    island opposite the<span class="pagenum">267</span> fort. Next day a council was held, and the terms
    of the captives surrender agreed upon. Three unserviceable horses,
    to replace ponies left with the Ogalallas by the Blackfeet, as a
    pledge for the captives return; also, fifty dollars worth of presents,
    some provisions, and a promise of a treaty when General Sully should
    return. The Indians remained about the fort nearly two weeks, and
    during that time efforts were made to induce the captive woman to
    leave the fort and visit them at their lodges, doubtless with the
    design of recapturing her. After making the captive some presents,
    they bade adieu. Two months later they returned, apparently very much
    disappointed when they found the captive had left for her home. They
    were soon again upon the war path.</p>

  <p>Personally appeared before me, a Notary Public for the District of
    Columbia, Mrs. Fanny Kelly, who is at this time a citizen of the State
    of Kansas, and being duly sworn, deposes and says:</p>

  <p>That in the year 1864, she started from Geneva, Allen County, Kansas,
    for the purpose of settling with her husband and family in Montana, and
    for this purpose she with her husband took all the goods and chattels
    they had, which are enumerated below, with amount and value.</p>

  <p>She further says she is now a widow and has a family to support.</p>

  <p>But she was for many months a prisoner, and taken captive by a band of
    the Sioux Indians, at the time at war with the white people, and with
    the United States, as follows: On the 12th day of July, 1864, while on
    the usually traveled road across the plains, and west of Fort Laramie,
    she, with her husband and family, with several other persons, were
    attacked by these Indians, and five of the party were killed, while she
    was taken captive. That the Indians took or destroyed all they had. She
    was a captive for five months, suffered hardships and taunts, and was
    finally delivered to the military authorities of the United States in
    Dakota, at Fort Sully.</p>

  <p>That the following is a statement of their goods and effects, including
    stock, as near as she can remember.<span class="pagenum">271</span> The whole account was made out and
    placed, as she is informed, in the hands of Dr. Burleigh, late delegate
    from Dakota, but which she can not find at this time. The amount and
    the leading items she knows to be as follows:</p>

  <div class="center mt5">THE TRUCE&mdash;A CAPTIVE WHITE WOMAN.</div>

  <p>Soon there was a gathering of what appeared to be all the Indians
    about, on an eminence of prairie one mile away, and in full sight of
    the camp. There came from the crowd three unarmed warriors toward the
    train, holding up a white flag which they planted in the ground about
    seven hundred yards off, and then retired.</p>

  <p>This was an unexpected phase to the affair. While we were making extra
    preparations for war, there came a truce. I sent Mitchell, my brave and
    efficient officer of the guard, with two Sioux half-bred interpreters
    to<span class="pagenum">275</span> ascertain the meaning of this overture. They found, on reaching the
    ground, a letter stuck in a stick, and directed to me. Without pausing
    to converse with the Indians, who were a few rods distant, my assistant
    returned to camp with the letter. That letter appeared to have been
    written by a white woman, a captive in the hands of the Indians, and
    read as follows:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Makatunke says he will not fight wagons, for they have been
      fighting two days. They had many killed by the goods they brought
      into camp. They tell me what to write. I do not understand them. I
      was taken by them July 12. They say for the soldiers to give forty
      head of cattle.</p>

    <p>“Hehutalunca says he fights not, but they have been fighting. Be
      kind to them, and try to free me, for mercy’s sake.</p>

    <p>“I was taken by them July 12.<br />
    <span class="pl5">(Signed) <span class="pl50">“<span class="smcap">Mrs. Kelly.</span>”</span></span></p>

    <p class="pt4">“Buy me if you can, and you will be satisfied. They have killed
      many whites. Help me if you can.</p>

    <p>“Unkpapas (they put words in, and I have to obey) they say for the
      wagons they are fighting for them to go on. But I fear the result
      of this battle. The Lord have mercy on you. Do not move.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>I replied to this letter as follows:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">“<span class="smcap">Mrs. Kelly</span>:</p>

    <p>“If you are really a white woman captive in the hands of these
      Indians, I shall be glad to buy you and restore you to your
      friends, and if a few unarmed Indians will deliver you at the place
      where your letter <span class="pagenum">276</span>was received, I will send there for them three
      good American horses, and take you to our camp.</p>

    <p>“I can not allow any party of Indians, few or many, to come to my
      train, or camp, while in this country.</p>

    <p>“Tell them I shall move when I get ready, and halt as long as
      I think proper. I want no advice or favor from the Indians who
      attacked, but am prepared to fight them as long as they choose to
      make war. I do not, in the least, fear the result of this battle.</p>

    <p>“Hoping that you may be handed to us at once for the offer I have made,</p>

    <p><span class="pl15">“I am truly,</span><br />
    <span class="pl5">(Signed)<span class="pl30">“<span class="smcap">Jas. L. Fisk</span>, Capt. Comd’g.”</span></span></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The above letter was sent back by the Indian messenger, and we awaited
    the result. In the afternoon we received the following reply:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“I am truly a white woman, and now in sight of your camp, but they
      will not let me go. They say they will not fight, but don’t trust
      them. They say, ‘How d’ye do.’ They say they want you to give them
      sugar, coffee, flour, gunpowder, but give them nothing till you can
      see me for yourself, but induce them, taking me first. They want
      four wagons, and they will stop fighting. They want forty cattle
      to eat; I have to write what they tell me. They want you to come
      here&mdash;you know better than that. His name Chatvaneo and the other’s
      name Porcupine. Read to yourself, some of them can talk English.
      They say this is their ground. They say, ‘Go home and come back
      no more.’ The Fort Laramie soldiers have been after me, but they
      (the Indians) run so; and they say they want knives and axes and
      arrow-iron to shoot buffalo. Tell them to wait and go to town, and
      they can get them. I would give them any thing for liberty. Induce
      them <span class="pagenum">277</span>to show me before you give any thing. They are very anxious
      for you to move now. Do not, I implore you, for your life’s sake.</p>

    <p>“My residence formerly Geneva, Allen County, Kansas.”</p>

  <blockquote>

    <p>“Your second communication convinces me that you are what you
      profess to be, a captive white woman, and you may be assured that
      myself and my party are eager for release, but for the present
      I can not accede to the demands, or gratify the wants of your
      captors. We are sent on an important trust and mission, by order of
      the great War Chief at Washington, westward to the mountain region,
      with a small party of well-armed and determined men, feeling
      entirely capable of defending ourselves; but we are not a war
      party, and our train is not intended for war purposes. Powder and
      shot we have, but no presents for the hostile Indians.</p>

      to stop me on my march. However, I will, for your release, give
      three of my own horses, some flour, sugar, and coffee, or a load of
      supplies. Tell the Indians to go back for the night, and to-morrow
      at noon, if they will send you with five men to deliver you to my
      soldiers on the mound we occupied to-day, their main body not to
      advance beyond their present position, I will hand over to them the

    Territory, of which expedition I was a member, being then an officer,
    First Lieutenant, in the Sixth Iowa Volunteer Cavalry. Whilst on the
    expedition, we ascertained that Mrs. Fanny Kelly was a prisoner of the
    Indians that we were then engaged against. After the command returned
    to Fort Rice, in Dakota Territory, news was received from Captain
    Fisk, an officer of the Engineer Department, U. S. A., that he was
    surrounded, and his train corralled by the same Indians that we had
    been fighting. I, with others, saw Fisk, and was personally told by
    him that he had received notes and letters of warning from Mrs. Kelly,
    telling him that he must not break his train, that the Indians intended
    to fall upon the two portions, if he did, and to massacre his guard and
    the emigrants and children with him.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">280</span></p>

  <p>In the fall, after the expedition had been abandoned, the troops were
    scattered at different posts along the Missouri River, I, with my
    company, being left at Fort Sully, Dakota Territory. About the latter
    part of November, an Indian came inside the post. I, being officer of
    the day, asked him what he wanted. He said he came a long way, and
    wanted to know if I was the “big chief,” if so, he had a paper for me
    to see. He gave it to me. It was a sheet torn out of a business book,
    and numbered 76 in the corner. The substance of the letter was as
    follows:</p>

  <p>“I write this letter, and send it by this Indian, but don’t know
    whether you will get it, as they are very treacherous. They have lied
    to me so often; they have promised to bring me to town nearly every
    day. I wish you could do something to get me away from them. If they do
    bring me to town, be guarded, as they are making all kinds of threats
    and preparations for an attack. I have made a pencil of a bullet, so
    it might be hard to read. Please treat this Indian well. If you don’t,
    they might kill me.” After having the Indian remain for a few days,
    and giving him plenty to eat, he was sent on his return with a letter
    to Mrs. Kelly. A short time after this, one morning, we discovered,
    back of the Fort on the hill, a large body of Indians. The commanding
    officer was notified of the fact. He immediately gave orders to prepare
    the fort for defense. Since the warning received from Mrs. Kelly,
    we had been unusually watchful of the Indians. The fort was poorly
    constructed, having been built by soldiers for winter quarters. The
    Indians were notified not to approach the fort, and only the chiefs,
    who numbered ten or twelve, were allowed to come inside the gates,
    bringing with them Mrs. Kelly, and when inside the fort, the gates were
    immediately closed, shutting out the body of the Indians, who numbered
    about 1,000<span class="pagenum">281</span> to 1,200. A bargain was made for her, and the articles
    agreed upon were delivered for her in exchange.</p>

  <p>I believe, and it was the opinion of others, that the advice and
    warning of Mrs. Kelly was very valuable to us, and was instrumental
    in putting us on our guard, and enabled us to ward off the threatened
    attack of the Indians. In my opinion, had the Indians attacked the
    fort, they could have captured it.</p>

  <p>The day that Mrs. Kelly was brought into the fort was one of the
    coldest I ever experienced, and she was very poorly clad, having
    scarcely any thing to protect her person. Her limbs, hands, and face
    were terribly frozen, and she was put in the hospital at Fort Sully,
    where she remained for a long time, nearly two months, for treatment.</p>

  </div>

  <hr class="short" />

  <p><span class="smcap">We</span>, the undersigned, late officers and members of the Sixth Iowa
    Cavalry, being duly sworn, do hereby depose and say that, during the
    winter of the years 1864 and 1865, the said Sixth Iowa Cavalry was
    stationed, and doing military duty, at Fort Sully, in the Territory
    of Dakota; that we, in our respective military capacities, were
    present during the winter stated at the aforesaid post of Fort Sully.
    Deponents further say that, on or about the 6th day of December, in
    the year 1864, an Indian appeared before the fort, and signified to
    the officer of the day, Lieutenant G. A. Hesselberger, that he had
    something to communicate to those within the fort; and the said Indian
    was allowed to enter, and presented to the commanding officer, Major
    A. E. House, of the regiment before stated, a note, or letter, which
    letter we all thoroughly knew the purport of, and it was seen and read
    by &mdash;&mdash;. It was written, or purported to be, by one Mrs. Fanny Kelly,
    who represented herself as a captive in the hands of certain Blackfeet
    Sioux Indians; and that, under a pretext of delivering her up to her
    people, they intended attacking the town or village to which they
    purposed going.</p>

  <p>Deponents further say that, at the time of the receipt <span class="pagenum">283</span>of this letter,
    the said Fort Sully was not in such a state of defense as would have
    enabled the garrison to hold it against the attack of any considerable
    body of men; that, in consequence of the receipt of said letter, Major
    House brought the cannon in position to bear on all sides of the fort,
    and otherwise ordered and disposed of the garrison to withstand any
    attempt to capture or destroy the fort.</p>

  <p>Deponents further say that, on or about the 9th day of December, the
    said Mrs. Fanny Kelly was brought in as a captive and delivered by
    the Indians to the commanding officer at Fort Sully; that the Indians
    came up to the fort painted in war paint, and singing their war songs;
    that as soon as Mrs. Kelly was within the gates of the fort, they were
    closed, and all the Indians save those who had her directly in charge
    were shut out from entrance into said fort.</p>

  <p>Deponents further say, that they verily believe, from information
    then gained, and from that which they afterward learned, it was the
    intention of the Indians to attack the fort, and they were only
    prevented from doing so by the preparations which the letter of warning
    from the said Mrs. Fanny Kelly had induced the commanding officer to
    make; and they verily believe that, had the attack been made without
    such preparations, it would have resulted in the capture of the fort
    and the massacre of its inmates; and such was the expressed opinion of
    nearly all the members of the said Sixth Iowa Cavalry then stationed
    therein; and further deponents say not.</p>
